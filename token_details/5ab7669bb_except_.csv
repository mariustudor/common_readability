Fati was also very busy. She found small pieces of firewood. She found very small pieces of firewood. Then Fati looked up. She saw a red bird in the tall grass. Next, Fati looked down. She saw a brown ant on the dusty path. Fati saw a beautiful leaf. The leaf was shiny and green. She put one finger on the beautiful leaf. Fati said, "This does not feel like a leaf." Suddenly, the beautiful leaf moved! Fati said, "This is not a beautiful leaf. This is a green snake!" Fati screamed, "Eii!" She ran very fast to look for her mother and father. Fati saw her father and shouted, "A snake! A snake!" Father said, "Where? Where?" Fati said, "There! There!" Then her father chased the green snake with a stick. The green snake slithered away. Father said, "Fati, you are safe. Let's go to mother and tell her about the green snake." Mother said, "Fati, I am happy the green snake did not bite you." "But next time, please, look where you go, and be more careful." And that was the end of that.
