Like Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease is also a neurodegenerative disease that causes movement problems and affects the basal ganglia. Unlike Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease is a genetic illness. This means that if either parent has the disease, the children are also very likely to have the illness. Huntington's Disease is a result of abnormal protein buildup in brain, which results in neuronal death, causing the movement disorder. Mainly, individuals with this disease will show excessive movement, movement that is generally unwanted and unnecessary. For example, they often have constant vibrating limbs, something that is out of their control. As the disease progresses, people with Huntington's will find it increasingly hard to move the way they want to move.In any neurodegenerative disease, if neurons are dying, then the brain is getting smaller! This is a serious problem and causes the person to have memory and thinking problems. These problems are a common feature of all neurodegenerative diseases.
