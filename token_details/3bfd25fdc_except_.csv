The king thundered, "My royal astrologer, tell me what I need to do to become emperor of the entire universe." "Your Majesty," the astrologer answered, "the stars say there is a one-hundred percent chance that you will become emperor of the entire universe." "Bravo, bravo!" Everyone in the royal court began to clap. The royal astrologer opened his mouth to stay something more, but stopped himself. The king noticed his hesitation and said to him, "Tell me what's on your mind. Do not be afraid!" The astrologer said, "Your majesty, we have an astonishing golden bird living in our kingdom. If you can catch that golden bird, no one will be able to stop you from becoming emperor of the entire universe." The king said, "This golden bird must be caught. Make arrangements to catch it now!" The royal announcer made a public circulation, "Anyone who catches the golden bird will be rewarded by his royal highness the king of Swarnadwip, Maharaja Rajabahadur."
