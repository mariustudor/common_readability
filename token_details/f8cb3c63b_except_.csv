The brave Geraint, a knight of Arthur's court, a tributary prince of Devon, one of that great order of the Table Round, had married Enid, Yniol's only child, and loved her, as he loved the light of Heaven. And as the light of Heaven varies, now at sunrise, now at sunset, now by night with moon and trembling stars, so loved Geraint To make her beauty vary day by day, in crimsons and in purples and in gems. And Enid, but to please her husband's eye, who first had found and loved her in a state of broken fortunes, daily fronted him in some fresh splendor; and the Queen herself, loved her, and often with her own white hands array'd and deck'd her, as the loveliest, next after her own self, in all the court. And Enid loved the Queen, and with true heart adored her, as the stateliest and the best and loveliest of all women upon earth. At last, forsooth, because his princedom lay close on the borders of a territory, wherein were bandit earls, and caitiff knights, assassins, and all flyers from the hand of justice, and whatever loathes a law.
