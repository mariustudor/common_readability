On the evening of Sept. 25 the railway and telegraph lines were destroyed on the Lovenjoul-Vertryck line.Consequently the two above-mentioned places on the morning of Sept. 30 had to give an account and to furnish hostages.In the future the communities in the vicinity of a place where such things happen (no matter whether or not they are accomplices) will be punished without mercy.To this end hostages have been taken from all places in the vicinity of railroad lines menaced by such attacks, and at the first attempt to destroy the railroad tracks or the telegraph or telephone wires they will be immediately shot.Furthermore, all troops in charge of the protection of the railroad lines have received orders to shoot any person approaching in a suspicious manner the railroad tracks or the telegraph or telephone lines.The Governor General of Belgium,(Signed) BARON VON DER GOLTZ,Field Marshal.
