Joe, who was a general favorite on account of his good looks and gentlemanly manners, and in spite of his shabby attire, was walking home with Annie Raymond, the daughter of the village physician, when Oscar came up.He was himself secretly an admirer of the young lady, but had never received the least encouragement from her. It made him angry to see his father's drudge walking on equal terms with his own favorite, and his coarse nature prompted him to insult his enemy."Miss Raymond," he said, lifting his hat mockingly, "I congratulate you on the beau you have picked up."Annie Raymond fully appreciated his meanness, and answered calmly:"I accept your congratulations, Mr. Norton."This answer made Oscar angry and led him to go further than he otherwise would."You must be hard up for an escort, when you accept such a ragamuffin as Joe Mason."Joe flushed with anger."Oscar Norton, do you mean to insult Miss Raymond or me," he demanded.
