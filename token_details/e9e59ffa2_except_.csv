The men were glad enough to get ashore, for they have been cooped on the transports most of the time since April 22nd, knocking about on the ocean. In that hot climate it is not over-agreeable to be on ship-board, even with ample room to move about in; but when crowded as the men on transports are, there is no end of discomfort.All Friday afternoon and evening the men worked away at their camp, and were tired enough when they were ordered to turn in for the night.Every precaution was taken to guard against a surprise, although no attack was expected. Saturday the men continued their work, which was getting along finely and almost completed, when late in the afternoon, while a large number of men were hauling water up the hill, and others, who had been working hard all day, were taking a swim in the bay, there was suddenly heard the sharp crack of Mauser rifles, and the men knew that the Spaniards were there.
