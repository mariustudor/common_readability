Afeefah is a baby white rhinoceros. Rangers rescued her from the bush. Her mum was killed by poachers. The rangers took Afeefah to a place of safety. Afeefah's heart was broken. And, she was afraid that the poachers would return to take her horn. Slowly, Afeefah made friends. She felt safe and played in the mud. She drank nutritious milk at the sanctuary. One day Afeefah asked her friend Aaminah, "Why do they want our horns?" Aaminah snorted, "They believe that our horns are magical!" "But our horns are not magical!" cried Afeefah. "No, of course not. Horns are the same as hair and nails," said Aaminah. Afeefah and Aaminah are the last of their kind. The white rhinoceros is nearly extinct. They are almost all gone from our world. We can save the rhino and other animals that are almost extinct. What can you do? Find out more!
