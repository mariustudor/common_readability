"Yesterday was a very long day," said Vrouw Vedder on the morning after Market Day. "You were gone such a long time."Kat gave her mother a great hug."We'll stay with you all day today, Mother," she said. "Won't we, Kit?""Yes," said Kit; and he hugged her too."And we'll help you just as much as we helped Father yesterday. Won't we, Kit?""More," said Kit."I shouldn't wonder!" said Father."I shall be glad of help," said Vrouw Vedder, "because Grandma is coming, and I want everything to be very clean and tidy when she comes. I'm going first to the pasture to milk the cow. You can go with me and keep the flies away. That will be a great help."Vrouw Vedder put a yoke across her shoulders, with hooks hanging from each end of it. Then she hung a large pail on one of the hooks, and a brass milk can on the other. She gave Kat a little pail to carry, and Kit took some switches from the willow tree in the yard, with which to drive away the flies. Then they all three started down the road to the pasture.
