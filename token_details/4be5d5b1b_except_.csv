HIV is a virus that attacks the immune system and weakens a person's ability to fight infections. There are around 37 million people living with HIV, mostly in Africa. Nearly two million people with HIV are under 15 years of age. Most of these children and some older adolescents/young adults were born with HIV. Medication can help people with HIV to lead normal lives, but many young people find it difficult to tell others that they have HIV. Telling others about having HIV can help people get more support, reduce their chances of passing HIV to others, and help them take medication as prescribed. Telling people about having HIV can also feel risky, though, because there is a chance that those people may not react positively. This article presents research focusing on ways to help young people with HIV think about sharing that information, and how we can support children to make the decision to share.
