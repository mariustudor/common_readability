Kwesi's parents were Papa and Maame. Maame always advised her son, "Don't swim in any river or sea because it is dangerous." During the school vacation, Kweku Twum travelled to Simpa (Winneba). He went to spend the holiday with his uncle, Kobina Amfo who was a very good fisherman. Kobina Amfo had many canoes at Simpa. When Kweku Twum returned from Simpa, he visited his friend Kwesi Gyasi. He told Kwesi about his experiences and enjoyment, especially swimming in the sea! Kwesi was interested and wished he had travelled with Kweku to the sea. One afternoon, the two friends decided to swim in the village stream. They went out when nobody was watching. As soon as they got to the stream, Kweku Twum jumped into the water with a splash. He called Kwesi Gyasi to join him but he did not. He remembered his mother's advice. But Kweku finally convinced his friend to swim. They really enjoyed themselves in the water. It was getting late and the sun was setting. Kweku told Kwesi to get ready to go home. He got out of the water, dried himself and put on his clothes. Kwesi was still in the water.
