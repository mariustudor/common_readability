Rosy went on her way, and forgot all about it. But she never forgot to be kind; and soon after, as she was looking in the grass for strawberries, she found a field-mouse with a broken leg."Help me to my nest, or my babies will starve," cried the poor thing."Yes, I will; and bring these berries so that you can keep still till your leg is better, and have something to eat."Rosy took the mouse carefully in her little hand, and tied up the broken leg with a leaf of spearmint and a blade of grass. Then she carried her to the nest under the roots of an old tree, where four baby mice were squeaking sadly for their mother. She made a bed of thistledown for the sick mouse, and put close within reach all the berries and seeds she could find, and brought an acorn-cup of water from the spring, so they could be comfortable."Good little Rosy, I shall pay you for all this kindness some day," said the mouse, when she was done.
