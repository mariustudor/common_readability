The next day he started building a huge compound in which to entertain his friend. As soon as the compound was completed, he asked Water to come and visit them. When Water arrived, he asked Sun whether it would be safe for him to enter. "Yes, come in, my friend," Sun answered. Water began to flow in. He was accompanied by crocodiles, fish, frogs, snakes, snails, flukes, turtles, and all the water animals. Very soon Water was knee deep. He asked Sun if it was still safe. "Yes," Sun again answered. So more of water's people came in. Water reached the level of the top of a person's head. He asked Sun, "Can more of my people come in?" Sun and Moon both answered, "Yes." Water flowed on, until Sun and Moon had to perch themselves on the top of the roof. Water's people continued to rush in. Very soon they reached the top of the roof. Sun and Moon were forced to go up into the sky. They have remained in the sky ever since.
