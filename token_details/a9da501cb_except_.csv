Johnny started the Flying Machine again and steered it toward the Moon. And as they whirled around the side of the Moon the part that resembled a man's face twisted about until it disappeared."I can't tell whether we are getting closer to the Moon or not!" cried Johnny anxiously.Presently, however, they saw the face of the Man in the Moon coming around from the other side."We must have made a complete circuit of the Moon," Janey decided. "See, Johnny, the rudder is pulled over to one side! That's the reason!"Johnny pulled the rudder string until the Flying Machine was aimed right at the Moon, and they approached it at great speed. "Slow up, Johnny!" Janey cried, when they could make out all the mountain tops and valleys very distinctly. "It feels too much as if we were falling when we go so fast."So Johnny twisted the "Start" spool backwards until they were flying very slowly and seemed to be floating down toward the Moon's surface as lightly as a feather.The Flying Machine still was headed directly toward the Moon, and this gave the children the impression that they were falling.
