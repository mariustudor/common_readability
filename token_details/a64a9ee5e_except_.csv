I live in a house. It shelters us from the rain, wind and sun. We have cups in our house. We use them to drink water, tea, juice and smoothies. We have flowers in our garden. They are pretty and smell nice too. My brother and I ride our bicycles. We have fun doing this. If I had a horse, I would ride it to my castle. I love my cat! I feed it cat food. If I had a tortoise, I would feed it lettuce. I see trucks on the road near my house. Trucks carry different things around. I am a super hero. I have rainbow powers! I love bright rainbow colours! I can enter a submarine. I can see water animals. I can change shape. I can move easily. I can enter a mouse's home to visit. Superheroes like to eat cake at parties. Cakes are sweet!
