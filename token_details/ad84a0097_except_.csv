One day Jackal felt sick. He tried drinking water, but that made his stomach swollen. He tried eating grass but still his stomach hurt. Jackal decided that only the medicine of man would help him so he dragged himself off to the clinic in the town. "Auwwwh" said the nurse when she saw the bedraggled jackal, "this place is for sick people, not animals. Go away!" Now Jackal was a clever animal, so sick as he was, he made a plan. He asked a boy called Ernst who was sitting outside the clinic, to help him by fetching the medicine from the nurse. "If you do this for me, I will give you a fat, fresh bird for you cooking pot, everyday." Ernst was hungry and anyway, he felt sorry for the sick jackal, with his drooping whiskers and his tail hanging like a rag, so he went in and got the medicine and gave it to the jackal. Jackal licked up all the medicine at once and immediately his ears stood up and his tail lifted.
