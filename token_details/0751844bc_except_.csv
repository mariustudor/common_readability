The author asks in the first place - what is the cause of the different specific gravities of one and the same metal according as it has been cast, rolled, drawn into wire, or hammered? Does the difference observed prove a real condensation of the matter under the action of pressure, or is it merely due to the expulsion by pressure of gases which have been occluded when the ingot was cast? According to well-known researches, metals such as platinum, gold, silver, and copper, which have been proved to occlude gases on fusion, and to let them escape, incompletely, on solidification, are precisely those which are most increased in their specific gravity by pressure. The author has submitted to pressures of about 20,000 atmospheres metals which possess this property, either not at all, or to a very trifling extent, and he finds that though a first pressure produces a slight permanent increase of density, its repetition makes little difference. Their density is found to have reached a maximum. Hence the density of solids, like that of liquids, is only really modified by temperature. Pressure effects no permanent condensation of solid bodies, except they are capable of assuming an allotropic condition of greater density.
