At this point, Hyena burst into laughter and began rolling on the ground. She said, "That is a striking truth!" Goat took advantage of this and ran, back towards his village. Hyena ran after Goat and soon caught up with him. "Give me another truth, quickly!" she ordered. Goat said, "The second truth is, if I go back to the village and tell them that I met you, but you didn't eat me, nobody will believe it." Again, Hyena began to roll on the ground with laughter. She said, "That is truth!" For the second time, Goat ran and got closer to the village. Very soon, Hyena caught up with Goat again. "There is still one more truth left unsaid!" Hyena shouted. Goat said, "The third truth is, if you keep joking around like this, it means that you are not really hungry!" Hyena laughed until she cried, rolling on the ground. "That is very true!" she giggled. Goat continued running towards his village. By the time Hyena caught up, Goat had already reached the village square. That is how He Goat saved his life.
