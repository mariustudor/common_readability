He's a very good fellow, but as mad as a hatter. He's called Madman, you know. And never was such a fellow for getting all sorts of rum things about him. He tamed two snakes last half, and used to carry them about in his pocket; and I'll be bound he's got some hedgehogs and rats in his cupboard now, and no one knows what besides.""I should like very much to know him," said Arthur; "he was next to me in the form today, and he'd lost his book and looked over mine, and he seemed so kind and gentle that I liked him very much.""Ah, poor old Madman, he's always losing his books," said Tom, "and getting called up and floored because he hasn't got them."
