Gong! Gong! Gong! We heard the village bell early in the morning. "Boys, wake up and prepare the tools," grandma called from her bedroom. We yawned and stretched out of bed. That day was nhimbe at Mbuya Sigauke's field. We went to the hozi and collected all the tools. We carried the tools to the fields. The whole Chamutsa village had come to help Mbuya Sigauke. Every farming season, the villagers help old people to weed their fields. Everyone is given a portion to weed. This portion is called ndima. When it was midday, the villagers sat under the big Mutsamvi tree to rest. Mbuya Sigauke gave the villagers maheu to drink. The villagers rested drinking maheu. After resting,the villagers finished weeding the field. Mbuya Sigauke was very happy. She thanked all the villagers for helping her. In Zimbabwe, people do nhimbe to help others do their work. Do you help people in your community?
