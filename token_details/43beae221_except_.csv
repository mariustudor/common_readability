In the same pasture with Snowball was a black lamb. He was the black lamb that Farmer Green once gave to Johnnie for a pet. But he ran away up the lane the very first time Johnnie tried to hold him in his arms.After that the black lamb had always stayed with the flock. He was a wild, unruly fellow, bigger and older than Snowball. And he was quite outspoken—and not always careful of his language.This black lamb chanced to be near Snowball when Johnnie Green came into the pasture on a certain fine morning. And when Johnnie began calling to Snowball the black lamb said, "Why don't you run the other way? That's what I always do when boys call me."Snowball made no answer. He stood and looked at Johnnie Green, who was walking towards him with outstretched hand."Come on!" cried the black lamb. "I'll run with you.""No!" said Snowball. "Johnnie may have something good for me to eat. Some salt, maybe!"
