As they were leaving the shop, Zethu saw an exquisite necklace. She wanted that necklace so much! But her mother could not afford the necklace. "It is lovely, my angel. I wish I had money to buy it for you," said her mother. Zethu was disappointed. She decided to save and buy the necklace herself. She put all her money in a piggy bank under her bed. "I will wear that necklace to my next graduation," thought Zethu. Eventually, she had saved enough money to buy the necklace. Then, Zethu remembered that very soon it was her mother's birthday. "I have spent all my money, what will I give her?" she wondered to herself. Zethu was very excited on the morning of her mother's birthday. "Happy birthday, mommy!" she said, giving a gift to her mother. Her mother opened the gift and found the necklace that Zethu liked so much.
