A long time ago, deep in the forests, King Leopard began to think about the future. He thought, "I'm getting old and one day, I'm going to die. A wise ruler should pick a successor while still young and healthy." But how could King Leopard choose? He loved all the members of the animal kingdom the same! King Leopard had an idea. He sent his messengers out into the forests. He told them to ask all the animals of the kingdom to come to the palace. He was going to have a big party and he was going to make an important announcement. Away the messengers ran, to all four corners of the forest. On the night of the party, all the animals were at the palace. They sang and they danced and had a great time. After the moon had risen above the trees, King Leopard came and stood in the middle of the clearing. The animals stopped their singing and dancing. They listened quietly as their king began to speak. He cleared his throat and said, "I've been thinking that it's time for me to pick a successor."
