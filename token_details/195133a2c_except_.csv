Imagine a person who has fallen into a coma. A coma can occur from many causes, such as a traumatic brain injury, a stroke, or maybe loss of oxygen from a near drowning. The comatose person is lying still on the bed, with eyes closed. The person does not show any sign of communication with the environment. We speak to the comatose person, but he or she does not respond and seems indifferent to everything that is happening. When a person is in a coma, this person is in what we call an unconscious state. But is the brain of a coma patient still working?There is a good chance that the brain of a person in a coma continues to process events from the environment, for example the footsteps of someone approaching or the sound of your voice when you speak to them. To measure the brain activity of a person in a coma, we use a tool called electroencephalography (EEG)
