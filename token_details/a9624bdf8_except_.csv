Gretchen had a lot of matches in her old apron. She had a little bunch in her hand. But she could not sell her matches. No one would buy them.Poor little Gretchen! She was cold and hungry. The snow fell on her curly hair. But she did not think about that.She saw lights in the houses. She smelled good things cooking. She said to herself, "This is the last night of the year."Gretchen got colder and colder. She was afraid to go home. She knew her papa would be mad at her, if she did not take some money to him. It was as cold at home as in the street. They were too poor to have a fire. They had to put rags in the windows to keep out the wind. Gretchen did not even have a bed. She had to sleep on a pile of rags. She sat down on a door step.
