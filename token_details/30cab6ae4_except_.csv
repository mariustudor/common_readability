Long ago, there was a famine in the land of Taraba. People were forced to dig in ant hills to find grains. There was a man called Vyandeh who couldn't provide food for his family. One day, he said to his wife, "Let me go and look for food." He left. While he was away, the wife couldn't wait for his return. So, she cooked some pumpkin that she got from her mother for the children, Vyangel, Avaungwa and Jessica. Vyandeh come back late, with nothing for the family. The wife, Aershimana welcomed him and asked, "Anything for the children to eat?" He replied, "No." She gave him some pumpkin, but it didn't satisfy him. He asked, "Where did you get the pumpkin?" Aershimana replied, "My mother keeps pumpkins on the roof of her room." At midnight, Vyandeh woke up. He decided to go to his mother-in-law to steal the remaining pumpkins. He went to get a ladder. He put up the ladder and climbed to the old woman's roof. Vyandeh began to walk across the roof towards the pumpkins. Suddenly he fell through the roof, making a big noise! Pararam!
