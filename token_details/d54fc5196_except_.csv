Childhood for plebeians was very different compared to their patrician counterparts since they were expected to enter the workforce at a much earlier age. Plebeians typically belonged to a lower socio-economic class than their patrician counterparts, and therefore did not have as many household servants. As a result, plebeian children were responsible for maintaining the household and caring for their aging parents.Education was limited to what their parent would teach them, which consisted of only learning the very basics of writing, reading and mathematics. Wealthier Plebeians were able to send their children to schools or hire a private tutor.Plebeians in ancient Rome lived in buildings called insula, apartment buildings that housed many families. These apartments usually lacked running water and heat. Not all plebeians lived in these run-down conditions, as some wealthier plebs were able to live in single-family homes, called a domus.Plebeian men wore a tunic with a belt at the waist and women wore a long dress called a stola.
