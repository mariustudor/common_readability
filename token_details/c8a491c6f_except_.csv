Teeth are protected by the hardest material in the body—enamel. It's harder than bones! Every person has tongue prints and fingerprints that are one of a kind!The liver has the power to grow back! Just a quarter of this organ is enough for it to grow back to its original size. The liver filters the blood that goes from our digestive system to the rest of our body. The small intestine helps digest the food we eat. If it was stretched out, it would be 20 feet long. That is the size of an adult giraffe!KHARRRRR! KHARRRRR! That's the sound we hear if we can't breathe easily while sleeping. Snores are a sign that the path from the nose to the lungs is not clear. LUB DUB! LUB DUB! That's the heart as it pumps blood. Tiny waves of electricity in the heart make it beat. GRAAUP! URRP! That's the sound of the stomach sending back the extra air that was swallowed. It's also called a burp.There are some organs in our body that aren't very important. The appendix looks like a sac and is attached to the large intestine.
