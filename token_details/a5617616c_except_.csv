A shepherd's dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him suffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood. On the road he met a sparrow that said to him, ‘Why are you so sad, my friend?' ‘Because,' said the dog, ‘I am very very hungry, and have nothing to eat.' ‘If that be all,' answered the sparrow, ‘come with me into the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.' Soon they went together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher's shop, the sparrow said to the dog, ‘Stand there a little while till I peck you down a piece of meat.' So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf, till at last down it fell.
