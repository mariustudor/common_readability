To protect ourselves and to protect others who may be more vulnerable to severe COVID-19, we can take some simple actions. According to the World Health Organization, it is essential to maintain some distance (1–2 m) when talking to other people. We should also avoid crowded places, wash our hands with soap and water frequently or use hand sanitizers that contain 70% alcohol. It is also very important to avoid touching our faces and to cover our mouths with our arms when we cough or sneeze. We may also be asked to wear face masks in public places. These procedures can help reduce the spread of the virus and help us make sure that hospitals do not get overcrowded, so that everyone who needs medical help can get it. All over the world, different treatments are being tested in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, but it will take some time to identify which drugs are effective and safe. Many drugs aim to prevent the virus from infecting other cells or from replicating to produce more viruses. Vaccines are also being developed
