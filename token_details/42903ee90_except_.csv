The parents gave a small pot as a gift to their daughter. Natabo loved that little pot. She loved to play with it. One day, by accident, the boys broke Natabo's pot. It broke into small pieces. The brothers did not know what to do. They threw the pieces into the bush. Natabo looked for her pot but did not find it. She got very upset and cried. She refused to eat anything. She begged her parents and brothers to find the pot, but they could not. Natabo became even more upset. She ran away and went to the forest. She climbed up the tallest tree in the forest. Natabo's parents searched for their daughter. They found her, and asked her to climb down. But she refused. They told her to come down, but she still refused. Natabo's brothers gathered and sang a song to ask her to come down. This is the song: "Our last born, come down and we can go home. We shall get a new pot!"
