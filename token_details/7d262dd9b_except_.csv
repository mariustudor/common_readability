Moon asked Rain, "What do you do that helps the earth?" Rain answered, "I give the earth water so that the trees and plants can grow well. I give water for animals to drink." Rain asked Wind, "What do you do that helps the earth?" Wind answered, "I sweep the earth clean. I scatter the rain over the whole earth." Wind asked Sun, "What do you do that helps the earth?" Sun answered, "I give the earth light and warmth, so that animals and plants can live." Sun, Moon, Rain and Wind listened carefully to each other. Then Sun said, "It is true that each of us helps the earth in our own special way." "Yes", said Moon, "Not one of us is better than the others." "We can work together," said Rain. Wind said, "Then let us share the days." They all agreed. And that is why you sometimes see the moon when the sun is shining. And sometimes you feel the wind when it is raining. Sun, Moon, Rain and Wind work very well together.
