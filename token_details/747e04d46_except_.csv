Johnny is late to meet his friends to go fishing. When he arrives at the beach, he realises that he's forgotten to bring his lifejacket. "Don't worry," says Ben, the boat owner. "Here's a spare one I always keep on board." Because he's been fishing for years, Johnny knows the right way to put on a lifejacket. He fastens the two straps across his chest and the two straps between his legs. "Right!" he says, "it's on firmly and I'm ready to go!" On the ocean, they find a good spot to fish and put down the anchor. Out of nowhere, a huge wave suddenly rises above them. "Look! The wave's going to hit us!" shouts one of the fishermen. The boat is turned upside down and the men are flung into the water. "Eeeeeehhh!" they yell as they are plunged into the icy water. Not all of them can swim but, luckily, they are all wearing lifejackets. The men cling to the side of the upturned boat. Ben always carries a cellphone in a plastic pouch tied to his lifejacket. He calls the free emergency number 112. "Help! We're in trouble out at sea," he says to the operator.
