And the little shepherd says: "Where are you going, wee Robin?"And wee Robin makes answer: "I'm going away to the King to sing him a song this glad Christmas morning."And the little shepherd boy says: "Come here, wee Robin, and I'll give you some crumbs from my lunch."But the wee Robin says: "No, no! little shepherd boy, no, no! You caught the Goldfinch, but you cannot catch me!"So the wee Robin flew away till he came to the King; and there he sat on a plowshare, and sang the King a cheery song. And the King says to the Queen: "What will we give to the wee Robin for singing us this cheery song?"And the Queen makes answer to the King: "I think we'll give him the wee Wren to be his wife."So the wee Robin and the wee Wren were married, and the King and the Queen, and all the court danced at the wedding. Then the wee Robin and the wee Wren flew away home to the wee Robin's own brookside, and hopped on the brier bush.
