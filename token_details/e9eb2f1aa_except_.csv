Especially at school, it can be very helpful to actively use your schema knowledge when you learn new information. You can do this in different ways. Before starting a lesson, you can revisit what you have learned before about a certain topic (for example, that fish lay eggs). Or, while studying, you can pause often and think about what you just learned and how the new knowledge links to what you already know. This will help you to use your medial prefrontal cortex to integrate new information and remember it better for tests. In addition, such integration helps you to build better schemas so you can remember new, related information even better in the future.Sometimes, we can use memory "tricks" to link new knowledge to our schema knowledge. For example, when learning a list of words, you can link these words to places in your room or another familiar environment. This is called the method of loci (loci means "places" in Latin). It is used by many people to remember arbitrary information that is hard to connect to schema knowledge, like a long grocery list.
