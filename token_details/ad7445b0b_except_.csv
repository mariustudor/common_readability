Once upon a time, in Joburg's Orange Grove, a little girl called Phyllis was born into the world. Two people in love hugged their sweet little babe. No one knew, then, what a dancer they'd made. By the time she was four, she had learned very quick. She impressed all her teachers with her ducky feet flicks! Before school and after, she danced every day. Nothing pleased Phyllis more than ballet. When the world was ready for Phyllis at fifteen, she arrived in big, old London, ready to live her dream. She said goodbye to all her friends. She was ready to start fresh. Watch out, Royal Ballet School! Phyllis is here to impress. When Phyllis danced Swan Lake, it was fit to show the Queen! After years of pirouetting, she was ready to be seen. Dancing for the audience, she turned and twirled about. Look! Everyone is smiling! See how they clap and shout!
