Grandma is coming to visit. And always she brings Thabo some peanuts and wild fruits or mealies and a melon, sometimes. Thabo wants to give Grandma something special too. A book would be lovely, but can Grandma read? If he went to the mall, would he get something nice? "Let's make her a bag," says Thabo with a smile. "A big strong bag in denim blue." Mother takes out the fabric they bought at the shop. She spreads out the pattern and begins to cut. First, the two main sides that are big and wide. Then two smaller ones to give it some shape. Thabo folds them together with the two main sides. He watches as Mother takes the pattern again. She cuts out the bottom in two long pieces. This is what will make the bag really strong. Thabo folds them as Mother takes the pattern again. She cuts out four straps that are wide and long. Two will be sewn together to make one strap. This will give the bag double strength.
