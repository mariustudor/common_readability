Sniffles did not want to be a crocodile. "I am so ugly," he thought, bursting into tears. He did not even want to live like crocodiles do. His best friend was Punch, a golden yellow butterfly. And Punch wanted to be big and strong. So, Punch always had her feeler curled into a fist saying, "Look out! I will punch you in the mouth." They made a very funny pair. Sniffles swimming with Punch perched on his head. The other crocodiles would laugh and make fun of them. That did not bother Sniffles. He continued crying, sniffling and being friends with Punch. One sunny afternoon, Punch settled herself near Sniffles' ear and told him, "I have seen two men come this way with guns, they want to kill crocodiles for their skins." "Don't these men have skins of their own?" asked a puzzled Sniffles. "I don't know Sniffles." replied Punch. "Tell the other crocodiles and hide." "But Punch, they might shoot you. Oh! What will I do?" cried Sniffles sobbing loudly. "People catch butterflies with nets and pin them on a board, my grandaunt told me," said Punch and flew away.
