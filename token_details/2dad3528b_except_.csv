There was a hyena and a donkey who lived near a city. They met by chance and became friends. They made an agreement to share food, and to defend themselves together. They did everything together. They even started living together. One day they went to a river to drink water. On their way they were chatting and laughing. At the river, the donkey went downwards and was drinking downstream. Hyena was drinking upstream. Suddenly the hyena stopped drinking. He complained, "Donkey, why are you stirring up the water?" Donkey kept silent and continued to drink. Hyena was very angry. "Don't you listen? I'm talking to you, Donkey," shouted the hyena. The donkey looked at the hyena and asked, "Since when did water move from downstream to upstream?" The hyena replied, "Water started to flow upstream when we became friends." The hyena had decided to eat the donkey. Helplessly, the donkey said, "It is my fault for thinking we could be friends. Alright, eat me then." Hyena jumped up and grabbed the donkey.
