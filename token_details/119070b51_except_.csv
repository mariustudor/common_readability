The horse and the cow, in great grief, came and stood by the side of the white sheep as he lay on the grass. They were fond of him in spite of all his faults. "Oh, why!" cried the cow, with tears in her eyes (and the bell that was hung round her neck shook and rang as she leaned over him),—"why did you leave the field with the black sheep?""He did it first," said the white one in a faint voice."Then why did you jump down that steep place? Could you not see that it was a pit?""I did not stop to see. He did it first," said the white sheep. Then, with a groan, he went on to ask, "How is the black sheep? Is he here too? And what does the man think who comes to see us?"
