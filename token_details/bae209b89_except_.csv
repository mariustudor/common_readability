After a night of heavy rain, a group of friends were on their way to school. They came to the river they had to cross every day. "Yoh! It's stopped raining, but look how full and fast the river is," said Siya. "Oh no," groaned Linda. "Do you think teacher will be angry if we miss our classes today?" Linda remembered what the Sea Rescue instructor had taught them in water safety lessons. "Never cross a flooded river. Even if you can't get to school," the instructor had said. Meanwhile, Lungi stepped straight into the river! "I know where the stepping stones are!" he yelled. But he soon fell into the water and the strong river began pulling him away. "Run and get help!" shouted Linda. "Tell them to call the free emergency number, like the Sea Rescue lady told us." "Help, help!" shouted Lungi as he struggled to keep his head above the water. "Hold on, Lungi!" shouted Phelelani, as he grabbed a branch that he could use to help his friend. Phelelani's class had been taught that they should never go into the water to help someone as they might also be washed away.
