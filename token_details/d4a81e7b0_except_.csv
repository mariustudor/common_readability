Careful investigation by our committees who have looked into the question of national defense brings to light the following conditions of affairs:According to official Government reports, there are barely 30,000 mobile troops in continental United States. These are distributed among fifty-two widely scattered posts, which would make it impossible to mobilize quickly at any given point. Even this small force is short of officers, ammunition, and equipment. Furthermore, it has no organized reserve.Our National Guard, with negligible exceptions, is far below its paper strength in men, equipment, and efficiency.Our coast defenses are inadequate, our fortifications insufficiently manned and without adequate organized reserves.Our navy is neither adequate nor prepared for war. This, our first line of defense, is inadequately manned, short of ammunition, and has no organized reserve of trained men. Our submarine flotilla exists chiefly upon paper. Fast scout cruisers, battle cruisers, aeroplanes, mine layers, supply ships, and transports are lacking. Target practice has been neglected or altogether omitted.
