There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. "Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse," thought Alice; "only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind."The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: "No room! No room!" they cried out when they saw Alice coming. "There's plenty of room!" said Alice, indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table."Your hair wants cutting," said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech."You should learn not to make personal remarks," Alice said with some severity: "it's very rude."The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he said was: "Why is a raven like a writing-desk?"
