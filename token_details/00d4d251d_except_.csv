In those days all cloth had to be made at home. Aunt Dinah, Aunt Chloe, and Aunt Dilsey were kept busy spinning and weaving to make clothes for the whole plantation.One day Mary's mother said, "Aunt Dilsey, Mary needs a new dress, and I want you to weave some cloth at once. Can you weave some very fine cloth?""Yes, ma'am," said Aunt Dilsey. "I have some cotton I've been saving to make her a dress."Aunt Dilsey got out the cards and carded the cotton smooth and fine. Then she fastened a roll of this cotton to the spindle and sent the wheel whirling around with a "Zum-m-m-m—Zum-m-m-m!"Mary stood and watched the old woman."Aunt Dilsey," she said, "the spinning wheel sings a song, and I know what it says. Grandmother told me. It says,'A hum and a whirl,A twist and a twirl,This is for the girlWith the golden curl!Zum-m-m-m-m-m!Zum-m-m-m-m-m!'""And that means you, honey," said Aunt Dilsey.When the yarn was ready, Aunt Dilsey fastened it in the loom and began to weave. The threads went over and under, over and under. As Aunt Dilsey wove, she hummed.
