When Wolferl was nearly six his father took him and Nannerl on a concert tour. Everybody wanted to hear them play and they gave many concerts.Wolferl spent all his boyhood with his music. He went to many places to play, even as far from Salzburg, in Austria (where he was born), as to Paris and London.Everywhere he went people were happy to see him and his sister and to hear them play. And they, too, were happy to play because they loved the music so much.When they reached Vienna they played for the Emperor and Empress.When Wolferl was presented to the Empress he jumped up into her lap and kissed her.Wolferl was always busy composing music. But he played games and had a good time just like any other boy. When he was busy with his music, however, he never let his thoughts go to anything else.
