So, saying, Tom flung himself out at the cottage door, and his wife thought he was going back to his work as usual; but she was mistaken. He walked to the wood, and there, when he came to the border of a little tinkling stream, he sat down and began to brood over his grievances."Now, I'll tell you what," said Tom to himself, "it's much more pleasant sitting here in the shade, than broiling over celery trenches, and thinning wall fruit, with a baking sun at one's back, and a hot wall before one's eyes. But I'm a miserable toiler. I must either work or see my family starve; a very hard lot it is to be a workingman.""Ahem," said a voice close to him. Tom started, and, to his great surprise, saw a small man about the size of his own baby, sitting composedly at his elbow. He was dressed in green - a green hat, a green coat, and green shoes. He had very bright black eyes, and they twinkled very much as he looked at Tom and smiled."Servant, sir!" said Tom, edging himself a little farther off.
