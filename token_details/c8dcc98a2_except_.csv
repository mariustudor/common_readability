Mr. Jacob saw them coming down the road, and was ready for them this time too. He took two pots and filled them with pitch, and over the top of the pitch he spread gold and silver money, so that if you had looked into the pots you would have thought that there was nothing in them but what you saw on the top. Then he took the pots off into the little woods back of the house. Now in the woods was a great deep pit, and all around the pit grew a row of bushes, so thick that nothing was to be seen of the mouth of the hole.By and by came the priest and the mayor and the provost to Mr. Jacob's house, puffing and blowing and fuming.Rap! Rap! Tap! They knocked at the door, but nobody was there but Mr. Jacob's wife.Was Mr. Jacob at home? That was what they wanted to know, for they had a score to settle with him.Oh, Mr. Jacob's wife did not know just where he was, but she thought that he was in the little woods back of the house yonder, gathering money.
