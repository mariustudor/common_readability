One day, the hyena's son died. A donkey heard the news.He ran to his relatives and said, "The hyena's son is dead." All the other donkeys said, "The hyena's son? That's good news. All the hyenas are our enemies." One old donkey said, "Brothers, we must go to the hyena's funeral and show respect." "What? Go to the hyena's funeral?" The other donkeys said. "We don't want to go. We're frightened. The hyenas will eat us." "Listen," said the old donkey. "If we don't go, the hyenas will be angry with us. They will have a reason to eat us." "You are right," said all the other donkeys. "We must go to the hyena's funeral. If we go, the hyenas will be happy with us. Perhaps they will become our friends." The hyenas saw the donkeys outside their house. "Why are the donkeys here? Have they come to laugh at us?" The hyenas wondered. The donkeys heard the hyenas. They were frightened and they began to sing.
