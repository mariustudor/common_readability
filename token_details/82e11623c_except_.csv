Long time ago Hare and Hyena were great friends. They did many things together. They danced and sang together. One day, Hare said, "My friend Hyena, let us start farming together and we will be rich." "Oh yes, we can plant a lot of food, harvest it, and sell it to others," Hyena said. "But what shall we plant?" asked Hare. Hyena suggested that it was good to plant maize. Hare agreed. Hare also told Hyena that it was good for them to share duties on the farm. "My work will be guarding the maize from birds," said Hare. Then Hare told Hyena to till the land, plant, and weed. Hyena complained that he had been given more work. But Hare said that the work of chasing birds was the most difficult and most important. "My work is not easy. I will be climbing trees and chasing birds away day and night. And you are not able to climb a tree," Hare explained. Hyena was convinced by Hare's words. He agreed to till the land alone. It was a lot of work. Hare did not help at all. After tilling the land, Hyena planted maize in the whole field, alone.
