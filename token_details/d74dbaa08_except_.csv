One Saturday morning, Tarik and Bedilu were taking their flock to the common grazing land. They also carried their school books to study for examinations. Bedilu said, "Let's play kisara for few minutes to relax our minds." Tarik replied, "No, we should start studying!" "We will study soon. Please play!" Bedilu begged. In the end, the boys played kisara. (Kisara is a game where players take turns throwing flat stones or coins into a small hole, standing about a meter away.) Without noticing, they played the game for about two hours. When they looked, they couldn't see their sheep anywhere. They ran everywhere searching for the sheep. From a distance, they saw a wolf chasing their sheep! Then they saw that the wolf had killed Tarik's sheep. He began crying. He knew that his father would punish him severely. When Bedilu took his sheep home, Tarik didn't go home. He decided to spend the night in the big tree not far from his house.
