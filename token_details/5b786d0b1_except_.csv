Chang-ngan was the old capital of China, a very great city indeed, and Pin-Too, the master to whom Pei-Hang was sent was the wisest man in it. And there Pei-Hang soon learned what the world was thinking about, and many things besides. And as soon as he was eighteen he took the red silk out of his pigtail and the silver chain from his neck; for grown-up people do not need charms to protect them from the Genii—they can generally protect themselves. When he was twenty, Pin-Too told him he could not teach him any more. "It is time for you to go back to your parents, and comfort them in their old age," he said. He looked very sorry as he said it, for Pei-Hang had been his favourite pupil. "I will start tomorrow, Master," replied Pei-Hang, obediently. "I will leave the city by the Golden Bridge." "No, you must go by the Indigo Bridge, for there you will meet your future wife," said Pin-Too. "I was not thinking of a wife," observed Pei-Hang, with some dismay. And Pin-Too wrinkled up his eyes and laughed.
