Termites are blind, and without the ants they wouldn't be able to reach the plants and quench their thirst. The amber ants protect termites from the ladybugs that surround them everywhere in the pasture. Termite wings are short and they can't fly and escape the ladybugs when the ladybugs attack. That's why the termites are so thankful for the ants, day and night. The ants are also responsible for the termites' eggs too. The ants carry them for the termites and hide them underground. When the eggs hatch, they lead them to feed on the roots of the juicy plants. That's why the termites are so thankful for the ants, day and night. One day, while the ants were carrying the eggs underground, one of the eggs fell and rolled over and over, away and away. The ants didn't notice the missing egg and went along their way. The egg ended up on a small leaf and hatched after a few days. A little insect came out. It was Terry the Termite.
