My cousin Kamohelo leans on her hoe. What do I do? What do I know? My aunt Keromang has a dress to sew. What do I do? What do I know? My uncle Khotso herds the cattle that low. What do I do? What do I know? Mama dries wheat when the wind does not blow. What do I do? What do I know? Papa rides a horse over mountains in snow. What do I do? What do I know? Grandpa's slow donkey walks to and fro. What do I do? What do I know? Grandma sings songs till the fire burns low. What do I do? What do I know? You know how to say yes. You know how to say no. That's what you do! That's what you know! Everyone laughs when you put on a show. Your work is to play. Your work is to grow.
