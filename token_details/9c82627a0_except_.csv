They invited all the animals to come and watch the race. Chameleon and Rabbit lined up and waited for the signal. As the race began, Chameleon jumped onto Rabbit's tail. The animals laughed and laughed. Rabbit did not realize that Chameleon was on his tail. Hearing the noise, Rabbit skidded to a stop. Chameleon jumped off Rabbit's tail. "Hey, watch where you're going! It's about time you got here," Chameleon shouted at Rabbit. Rabbit was amazed. He started running again. He did not know that Chameleon had once again jumped onto his tail. As Rabbit approached the finish line, the animals saw that Chameleon was still on Rabbit's tail. They clapped and laughed. Rabbit heard the noise and thought that Chameleon had already arrived ahead of him. When they arrived at the finish line, Chameleon jumped off Rabbit's tail. "Don't step on me! I got here first!" Chameleon shouted at Rabbit.
