Pee-wee and Pepsy were not agreed about allowing this third person to buy into their enterprise. Pepsy was suspicious because she could not understand it. But Pee-wee, quick to forget dislikes and trifling injuries, was strong for the new partner."He's all right," he told her, "and scouts are supposed to be kind and help people and maybe he wants to reform and we ought to help him get into business.""He's a smarty and I hate him and three is bad luck," was all that Pepsy could say. Then she broke down crying, "Miss Bellison hates him, too," she sobbed, "and—and if people sit three in a seat in a wagon one of them dies inside of a year. Now you go and spoil it all by having three.""You get three jawbreakers for a cent," Pee-wee said. "Lots of times I bought them three for a cent, and I bought peanut bars three for a cent too, and I never died inside of a year, you can ask anybody."
