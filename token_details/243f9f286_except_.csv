Living things are different from things that are not alive. It is usually easy to tell what is living and what is not, except with really small "microscopic" life forms and colorless, lifeless-looking mosses. Here are some properties of living things. Some non-living things can have some of these properties. Living things can change and grow. However, volcanoes also change and grow. Living things can move. However, the wind is moving air, and water always moves downhill. You probably want to know how plants can move. They can grow, and sometimes move more rapidly than that, in response to things such as the sun or water. One example is that sunflowers will turn during the course of the day so that they are always facing the sun. Another example is that if a plant gets tipped over, it will want to turn upwards. Living things can reproduce. That is, they can produce copies of themselves, over and over. This is the most important difference between living and non-living things. In order to reproduce, living things need nutrition, that is chemicals and energy sources in order to assemble the materials needed to reproduce themselves. In this process, living things must excrete waste.
