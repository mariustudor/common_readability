One day the children were out in the fields, running races, picking flowers, and making daisy-chains!When they began to feel tired and hungry, they got milk and cake out of mother's basket, and had a long rest on the dry, warm grass.'How these buttercups shine!' said Dora; 'they look like gold!''Gold-cups, they ought to be called, not butter-cups,' said Harry. 'They look like cups, don't they?''But they would not hold water like real cups. Look at this one; it is in five pieces.''Five? Oh yes! And look underneath. There is another sort of cup with five leaves in it.''Only it is not bright and golden, but green and hairy.''Now, you found that out, and I found the five yellow leaves. It is my turn again. I can see yellow threads standing up in a ring all round the middle of the cup, and their tops are thick.' 'It is my turn now! In the very middle there is a green heap. It looks as if the yellow threads were taking care of it.'
