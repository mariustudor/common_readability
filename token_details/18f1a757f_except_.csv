After losing the trail many times only to stumble into it again and again, and then slipping, sliding, or jolting down the steep side of the mountain where the timber-line ended near the cliff, Eleanor finally recognized the ravine where the cave was located."Oh, thank heavens! We're almost there," she cried, trying to find the easiest way down to the ledge.Polly and Anne were sitting before the entrance to the cave, when they heard shouts and saw three weary riders coming along the rocky ledge that led to their refuge."Why—it's Nolla and Bob and a man!" exclaimed Polly, jumping up to run and meet the girls."What's wrong—any one hurt?" cried Anne, the moment she saw the faces of the girls.Eleanor then told about the forest-fire, and where the men were. The more recent excitement had quite driven the story of Hank and his claim-jumpers from her mind. But Polly anxiously asked for her mother.
