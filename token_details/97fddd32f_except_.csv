All the animals burst out laughing as they looked at Bonney. Bonney stopped and looked at them and asked, "What is so funny?" "Are my back doors opened? Are my front tires flat? Is my rearview mirror out of place?" Rabbit came up to Bonney and said, "Why are you pretending you are a car? Bonney said, "I'm not pretending. I am a car. I have four doors. Beep! Beep! Beep…Vroom!" Mrs. Goose pointed to Bonney's reflection in the lake and said, "Bonney, you are a h-o-r-s-e." Bonney looked at her image and opened her mouth to look at her teeth and shook her head saying, "I don't see a horse." Then she opened her mouth and said, "Look at this engine, I put oil in it, so it won't overheat." Mrs. Duck laughed and tried to convince her saying, "You are a horse, with four hooves, Look!!" Bonney looked at her hooves and shook her head saying, "I have four tires, and I drink gas to move."
