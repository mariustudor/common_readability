A typewriting machine can write much more quickly than any penman—and the work it does has the advantage of being easy to read, whereas very few people write a clear and legible hand.In office work much of the writing to be done is making entries in books and copying into ledgers.All this has had to be done by hand, and it has of course taken a much longer time to do.By means of this new invention books can be kept and entries copied with the same neatness and speed of an ordinary typewriter.The great difficulty in making a machine to do this work properly was that it was not possible to have the paper move back and forth as it does in typewriting machines generally. For bound books the paper must remain still, and the type moves over the page in the same manner that the pen does.The new book typewriter has mastered this difficulty. The page is held firmly in a kind of frame, and the type moves with each letter or word that it writes.
