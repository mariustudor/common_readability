Long ago, there was a clever cat and a foolish dog. The clever cat lived well in a wealthy family's house. The foolish dog starved on the street. "How is it that a wealthy family allows you to live in their house?" the foolish dog angrily asked the clever cat. The clever cat replied, "I live with people because I'm neat and I bury my waste. I ask for food saying, meow." "If I do the same, will they allow me to live in a house?" asked the dog. The cat replied, "Yes, do what I have told you and they will allow you. They will give you food." The foolish dog said, "Today, I will not hurt you." "He almost got me this time. I don't want to meet him again," said the cat, jumping away. Based on the cat's advice, the foolish dog barked loudly at the door of a house. "The cat fooled me. I will eat her when I get her," shouted the foolish dog.
