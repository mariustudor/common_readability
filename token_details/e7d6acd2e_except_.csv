This is Billy. He is the goat Jan was given by his father as a gift. Even though Billy is stubborn, Jan loves him very much. He always gives birth to healthy kids that Jan and his father sell. Yesterday Billy went out of their compound with her two kids. Jan does not like this because the kids easily get stolen or be eaten by dogs. Billy chewed the books containing all the homework Ann had done. Ann was angry that she was going to be punished by her teacher. She kicked Billy very had. This made Jan angry. He locked himself in his room to play with his toys. Jan is afraid that his father will sell Billy for what he has done. However, Mr. Tom, his father does not want to annoy his son by selling Billy. He has promised to wait until the kids are old enough so that he can give one to Jan.
