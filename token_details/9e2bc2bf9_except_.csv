The United States Supreme Court's approach to the unlawful delegation of legislative power has changed over time. Initial cases like Panama Refning Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388 (1935), and A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935) required Congress to include clear limits on presidential discretion in order for there to be a valid delegation. The modern approach requires Congress to lay out an "intelligible principle" to guide administrative and judicial agencies. Under the current three part test, established by Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 373 (1989), Congress must delineate the "general policy" to be executed, designate the agency that is expected to execute the policy, and specify the limits of the delegated authority. Advertisements are generally not offers that a consumer can unilaterally accept under Contract Law. They are offers to negotiate. In order to be offers, there must be clear terms. In most cases, advertisements state a price or terms, and include fne print that says it is conditional "on approved credit."
