The constitution of a country (or a state) is a special type of law document that tells how its government is supposed to work. It tells how the country's leaders are to be chosen and how long they get to stay in office, how new laws are made and old laws are to be changed or removed based on law, what kind of people are allowed to vote and what other rights they are guaranteed, and how the constitution can be changed.Limits are put on the Government in how much power they have within the Constitution (see Rule of Law). On the other hand, countries with repressive or corrupt governments frequently do not stick to their constitutions or have bad constitutions without giving freedom to citizens and others. This can be known as dictatorship or simply "bending the rules." A Constitution is often a way of uniting within a Federation.
