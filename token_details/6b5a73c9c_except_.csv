All who ride have been troubled at times what to do with the bicycles when they are standing still.It may be there is damp grass, which would make it impossible to lay the precious wheel down; or there may be a thousand other little inconveniences.Some one has come to the aid of the bicyclist, and invented a bicycle support, which can be secured to the machine, and raised at will, so as not to interfere with the wheel when in motion. It is just the thing all bicyclists have been longing for.Another busy brain has been at work in anticipation of the summer, and the glorious time in store, riding along the country roads.An umbrella support is the result. It consists of an attachment composed of portions which can be connected or removed at will.What a boon it will be, on a hot summer's day, to have an umbrella comfortably held over one's head, while the hands are free to guide the wheel!
