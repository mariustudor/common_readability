In a village there was a disagreement among people of different occupations. Everyone thought their work was the most important! The teacher said that he had the most important occupation. "Without teachers you could not go to school and learn." The builder said that he had the most important occupation. "Without builders you would not have schools to learn in or houses to sleep in." The carpenter said that he had the most important occupation. "Without carpenters you would have no furniture for your houses and schools." The doctor claimed that he had the most important occupation. "Without doctors and nurses, you could get sick and die The farmer said that she had the most important occupation. "Without farmers you would not have food to eat." The student argued that students had the most important work. "Without students, there would be no teachers, builders, doctors, farmers, or carpenters." Eventually everyone agreed that all the occupations are important. We need teachers, builders, doctors, farmers, and carpenters. But everyone has to be a student first!
