One of the birds fell to singing, and the other bird said, "Who told you to sing?"He answered, "The flowers and the bees told me. The blue sky told me, and you told me.""When did I tell you to sing?" asked his mate."Every time you brought in tender grass for the nest," he replied. "Every time your soft wings fluttered off again for hair and feathers to line it."Then his mate asked, "What are you singing about?""I am singing about everything," he answered. "I sing because I am happy."By and by five little speckled eggs were in the nest, and the mother bird asked, "Is there anything in all the world as pretty as my eggs?"A week or two afterward, the mother said, "Oh, what do you think has happened? One of my eggs has been peeping and moving."Soon another egg moved, then another, and another, till five eggs were hatched.The little birds were so hungry that it kept the parents busy feeding them. Away they both flew. The moment the little birds heard them coming back, five yellow mouths flew open wide."Can anybody be happier?"
