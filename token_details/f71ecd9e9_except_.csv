One day, he called his sons and said, "I am old and will die soon. But before I die, I want to see you in your own homes. You have one month to each make your own home. I want to see you back here after the month." The two sons rushed out. The first one went to the roadside. He cut down trees and began to build a big compound for himself. The second one, however, went out and started forming special relationships with other families. He went to different people, and he became like their foster child. After a month, the two brothers came back to their father. The father said, "Well, have you built your homes?" And both of the brothers said, "Yes." The father went with his eldest son. He saw that the son had built many huts. As he walked by each hut, he asked, "Is there anybody in this hut?" Each time, the son replied, "No."
