Quiet and patient she waited in the little anteroom, close to the queen's bedchamber, waited until she felt sure the royal pair were fast asleep. Then tripping lightly on tiptoe, she stole into the bedroom, where, as she had guessed, both king and queen were slumbering sound.She crossed the room, quiet as any mouse, and reached the toilet table. There lay the king's gold comb, and close to it the little pearl knife, the king's wedding gift to his queen.Back tripped Margaret, still on tiptoe, to the ante-room, and stood, her breath coming quick.Had she roused the king or queen? Was that the bed creaking?No, there was not a sound. The royal pair slept sound as before.Then downstairs in the dark fled Margaret, down to the room where Sir John Carmichael lay slumbering, without a thought of his prisoner, the young Laird of Logie.
