"Madam," said the white rooster, bowing very low, "your trouble is my own, — that is, I'm hungry, too. But we might be worse off. We might be in a box on our way to market. It is true that we haven't had anything to eat today, but we at least have room enough to stretch our wings." "Why, that is a fact," clucked the brown hen. And all the feathered family — even the smallest chickens — stretched their wings, and looked a little more cheerful. "Now, then," went on the rooster, "suppose we have a little music to cheer us and help pass the hours until roosting time. Let us all crow. There, I beg your pardon, ladies; I am sorry you can't crow. Let us sing a happy song. Will you be kind enough to start a merry tune, Mrs. Brown Hen?" The brown hen shook herself proudly, tossed her head back and began, — "Ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca!" In less than two minutes every one in the henhouse had joined her. The white rooster was the loudest of all, and the little bantam rooster stretched his neck and did the best he could.
