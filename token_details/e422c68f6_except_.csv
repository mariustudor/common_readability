Studies have shown that people who are more grateful than others will automatically think about the things that happen to them in a more positive way. Most situations that happen in our lives are not 100% good or 100% bad. How we think about or interpret what happens to us plays a big role in how we feel about the situation. Most people have learned "thinking habits" that they repeat over and over again.One of these thinking habits is what is called a "positive interpretation bias," which means that you are more likely to interpret a neutral or negative situation in a more positive way. For example, after falling off your bike, you could think "I got so lucky that I did not get hurt" and feel very grateful. Or, you could think "I can't believe I was so stupid to fall of my bike" and feel really angry. Having the grateful thoughts would be an example of a positive interpretation bias.
