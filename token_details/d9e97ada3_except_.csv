Alice was the youngest of the Parlin family. When Grandma Read called the children into the kitchen, and told them about their new little sister, Susy danced for joy; and Prudy, in her delight, opened the cellar door, and fell down the whole length of the stairs. However, she rolled as softly as a pincushion, and was not seriously hurt."But you can't go into mother's room," said Susy, "you're crying so hard.""Poh!" replied three-years-old Prudy, twinkling off the tears; "yes, I can neither. I won't go crying in! I didn't hurt me velly bad. I'm weller now!"So she had the first peep at the wee dot of a baby in the nurse's arms."O, dear, dear," said she, "what shall I do? I are so glad! I wish I could jump clear up to the sky of this room! How do you do, little sister?"The baby made no reply."Why! don't you love me? This is me: my name's Prudy. I've got a red pocket dress;—Santa Claw bringed it."Still the little stranger paid no heed,—only winked her small, bright eyes, and at last closed them entirely.
