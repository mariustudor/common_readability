Some large features on Earth were caused by water. The Grand Canyon was formed by the Colorado River. There are many rivers as big. There are rivers that are much larger. The Mississippi River is the largest river in the U.S. Only the Colorado has formed such a large canyon. The Grand Canyon is its own league.In most cases, water is harmless. Over time, water can have a great effect. When water runs over the land it can wash the soil away. With enough time, it can carve through rock. Given enough time, it can create a canyon over a mile wide. It is hard to believe that water created the Grand Canyon.Scientists have learned that the Grand Canyon took a long time to form. Every time it rained, the water ran across the ground. A little soil and rock were washed away with every rainstorm. Water can cause a lot of change if it has time. Scientists are unsure of the canyon's exact age. What they do know, it is old.A lot of people visit the Grand Canyon every year. They are amazed at its size. Some people hike to the bottom of the canyon.
