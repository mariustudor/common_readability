Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with:"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.""We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit.""But you forget, mamma," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.""I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.""No more have I," said Mr. Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you."
