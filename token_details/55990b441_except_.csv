The previous arthropods may seem pretty harmless or, at the worst, we may think they are pests. because they are annoying. But spiders tend to create a lot of fear in people. This is due to the fact that almost all spiders are venomous, and some have large enough fangs to bite humans. However, other than a few species, most spiders are harmless, avoid humans, and are beneficial as predators of pests and parasites This is good news, because in our study we found that two families of spiders, cobweb spiders and cellar spiders, were found in 100 and 84% of homes, respectively. In fact, we found evidence of cobweb spiders in 65% of the rooms we sampled. Spiders are very good at surviving for long periods of time without food and can live in the less-than-ideal environment that houses provide. Spiders are not the only predators to become accustomed to homes. House centipedes, or "thousand-leggers" may be even more terrifying to people. These many-legged arthropods can thrive indoors where the humidity is right.
