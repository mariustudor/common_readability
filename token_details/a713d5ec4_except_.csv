Once upon a time, there was a goat called Igodhoobe. Igodhoobe the goat was the king of farm animals and birds. He lived a good life. One day, Igodhoobe the goat called all the animals and birds to a meeting. "My friends, I have called you because I had a dream," said the goat. All the animals and birds kept quiet. They listened to their king carefully. "I dreamed that there was no food or water left in the land. Many of our relatives died!" said the king. When the animals and the birds heard the dream, they were worried. "What shall we do?" asked the cat. The hen and the duck had an idea. They said, "Let each one of us bring food and put it in the king's store." All the animals agreed with this idea. The king made a rule. He said, "Get ropes. Tie up anyone who does not bring food to my store. Then carry him to me." But, soon after this, it was time for a new king to rule over the farm. All the animals and birds met and elected the cat as their new king.
