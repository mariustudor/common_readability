As he ran to Fred's shop, Walugo remembered crunchy fried tail and fins. And the eyes, so sweet and tasty! Eventually, Walugo chose his three fishes. Fred added a fourth fish, but it was tiny. On the way home, Walugo stopped to eat the tiny fish. He ate slowly, including all the soft bones. It was delicious. He began to think about the three fishes in his bag. Three fishes with crunchy fins and tails. When Walugo finally arrived home, his angry mother asked, "Where have you been all this time?" She opened the bag and looked inside. "What happened here?" she asked. The fishes had no fins, or tails, or heads! Walugo wished that he had not been so greedy. He finally said, "I don't know what happened." His mother looked at him, but did not say anything. That night, Walugo and his family sat down to eat. His mother served each person, except Walugo. They began to enjoy the fried fish and ugali. Walugo asked, "Where's my food?" "I don't know where your food is," answered his mother. "Perhaps your food is with the fins, tails and heads that disappeared," said Walugo's father.
