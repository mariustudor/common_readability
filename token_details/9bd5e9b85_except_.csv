High above the earth, over land and sea, floated the seed-down, borne on the autumn wind's strong arms."Here shall you lie, little seed-down," said he at last, and put it down on the ground, and laid a fallen leaf over it. Then he flew away immediately, because he had much to look after.That was in the dark evening, and the seed could not see where it was placed, and besides, the leaf covered it. Something heavy came now, and pressed so hard that the seed came near being destroyed; but the leaf, weak though it was, protected it.It was a human foot which walked along over the ground, and pressed the downy seed into the earth. When the foot was withdrawn, the earth fell, and filled the little pit it had made.The cold came, and the snow fell several feet deep; but the seed lay quietly down there, waiting for warmth and light. When the spring came, and the snow melted away, the plant shot up out of the earth.
