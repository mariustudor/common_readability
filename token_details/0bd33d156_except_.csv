Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most common brain disorders in children. TBI often occurs due to a strong blow to the head from getting hit by an object, running into an object, or falling on one's head. TBI can be very dangerous because it can severely damage the brain, which is critical for controlling the body and the personality, as well as speech, movement, and much more. Depending on what part of the brain is hurt, there can be serious consequences. Because of this, it is important to be able to diagnose a TBI as soon as it happens.When the brain is damaged, the consequences of the injury can be very serious. However, studying the brain is difficult, because the brain is enclosed in the skull. Therefore, it is hard to tell whether or not there is injury and how severe it is. Currently, the most common way to look inside the brain is through a process called imaging, with several types of images giving us different insights into the brain.
