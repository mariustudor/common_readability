One summer Aksionov was going to the Nizhny Fair, and as he bade good-bye to his family, his wife said to him, "Ivan Dmitrich, do not start today; I have had a bad dream about you."Aksionov laughed, and said, "You are afraid that when I get to the fair I shall go on a spree."His wife replied: "I do not know what I am afraid of; all I know is that I had a bad dream. I dreamt you returned from the town, and when you took off your cap I saw that your hair was quite grey."Aksionov laughed. "That's a lucky sign," said he. "See if I don't sell out all my goods, and bring you some presents from the fair."So he said good-bye to his family, and drove away.When he had travelled half-way, he met a merchant whom he knew, and they put up at the same inn for the night.
