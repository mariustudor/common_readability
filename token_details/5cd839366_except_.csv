We know these motor representations are stored in the brain. But where in the brain?One of the best ways to answer that question is to study patients with brain damage. Previous studies have shown that the motor representations for familiar movements, like brushing teeth, are located in an area of the brain called the left parietal lobe. The parietal lobes are located on the sides of our brains. They process sensations from our body, such as touch, movement, pain, and temperature. They are also important for creating and storing motor memories, as well as some other things that we do not discuss in this paper. Motor adaptation is the term we use for learning a new movement skill. Motor adaptation was found to be impaired in two patients with parietal lobe damage. One patient had damage to the parietal lobes on both sides of the brain and the other had damage to only the left parietal lobe. However, because a patient with damage to only the right parietal lobe was not examined, we do not know if the left parietal lobe is more important than the right parietal lobe.
