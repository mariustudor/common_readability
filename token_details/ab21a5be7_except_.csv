Amara loved animals very much. Amara lived with her mother, Margy. She was a very hardworking farmer. Amara's father died when she was 5 years old. When Amara was not at school, she spent her time with Mbisa, the goat. She cleaned and fed it. Amara also had her pet, Simba. Her mother did not like dogs very much, but she let Amara keep Simba. Whenever Simba disturbed her, she would shout, "Go away before I kick you out." Amara felt sad. One Saturday, they had visitors from the women's group. Amara was happy that her mother's friends had come with their children. They could play football. Her mother had prepared the food that the group liked. Amara was reminded by her mother to keep Simba locked up. It barked at strangers. Amara did not lock up Simba well. The visitors were surprised to see the dog in the room. Mama Oto asked, "Why do you allow the dog to come inside the house?" Amara's mother called Amara to come and take Simba out. Amara did not hear her mother calling because they were busy playing. When Amara went to the house, she called Simba out. Simba was very obedient to Amara.
