Depression is the most common mental illness. Four point four percent of the world's population suffers from depression. This is an alarming 322 million people, which is about the total population of the U.S.A! For most people, depression starts when they are young, before 30 years of age, and as depression often lasts a long time, many people suffer from it for a large part of their lives. People with depression experience prolonged periods of feeling very sad and/or lose the ability to feel pleasure. They commonly describe a feeling of emptiness, worthlessness, guilt, loss of hope, or lack of interest in many activities they used to enjoy. These feelings are often accompanied by other symptoms, such as trouble thinking clearly or carrying out day-to-day tasks, difficulty sleeping at night, feeling fatigued during the day, and reduced appetite. Depression is the leading cause of disability world-wide and many people who suffer from it cannot function well-enough to work, study, or maintain their relationships with family and friends.
