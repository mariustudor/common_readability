The tube that communicates with the vessel, F, is put in communication, after the latter has been completely filled with water, with the point of the cock, B. Then the latter is opened, as is also the pinch cock on the rubber tubing, and water is allowed to enter the burette through the bottom until the level is at the zero of the graduation. There are then 100 cubic centimeters in the burette. The superfluous gas has escaped through the cock, A, and passed through the water in the funnel. The cock, A, is afterward closed by turning it 90°. To cause the absorbing liquid to pass into the burette, the water in the graduated cylinder is made to flow by connecting the rubber tube, S, of the bottle, S, with the point of the burette. The cock is opened, and suction is effected with the mouth of the tube, R. When the water has flowed out to nearly the last drop, B is closed and the suction bottle is removed.
