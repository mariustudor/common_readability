Frederick Fleet, who was lookout in the crow's nest of the Titanic when the giant liner smashed into the iceberg, made oath that not a single lookout on the Titanic was provided with marine glasses and declared that had his request for such glasses in Southampton not been refused the Titanic might yet be afloat. "I could easily have sighted the iceberg with marine glasses in plenty of time to have the vessel steered out of the way." said Fleet, and gave in detail the request he made in Southampton for them. Although all other liners are so provided, Fleet swore, his request was flatly refused and he was told there were no glasses for him.Third Officer Pittman admitted that the Titanic had been warned that icebergs were prevalent, but said he did not see any on the Sunday of the disaster. He declared that in his 14 years' experience he had seen only one iceberg before.
