Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house; and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house. And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre. Then said the king unto her, "What wilt thou, Queen Esther? and what is thy request? It shall be given thee even to the half of my kingdom."And Esther answered, "If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him."Then the king said, "Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said."So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
