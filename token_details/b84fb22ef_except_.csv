Lion said to Hyena, "Can't we even find peace in our dens? You throw dust into our eyes!" Hyena answered, "King, I did not mean to disrespect you! I am only running after my food!" Lion said, "You are food to me, too, Hyena. Did I chase you? You came to me. Don't blame me later." Then Lion said to Sheep, "Why did you come to the bush?" Sheep replied, "I came because I am a diviner." Lion said, "Prepare traditional medicine to prove that you are truly a diviner." Sheep replied, "My medicine is expensive." Lion said, "That is no problem, whatever it costs. There is nothing that is impossible for me." Sheep said, "The medicine is Hyena's ear." Lion cut off Hyena's ear and gave it to Sheep. Sheep put Hyena's ear inside a jar of honey and gave it to Lion. Lion ate Hyena's ear and found it so sweet.
