Among many interesting reminiscences and reflections, this dignified and delightful old gentleman said he thought the young people of today were less mannerly than in the olden time, less deferential, less decorous. This may be true, and I tried to be sufficiently deferential to my courtly host, not to disagree with him. But when I look upon the young people of my own acquaintance, I recall that Jamie took the hand luggage as naturally as if he were born for nothing else; Frank never failed to open a door; Arthur pulled out Maggie's chair at table before he took his own; Nelly and Ruth came to my party sweet and bright as if they did not know that the young gentlemen whom they had expected to meet were prevented from attending; while Lucy will run herself out of breath for you, and Mary sits and listens with flattering intentness, and Anne and Alice and—well, looking over my constituency, I find the young people charming.
