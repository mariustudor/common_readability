In many industries there are operations that have to be repeated at regular intervals, and, for this reason, the construction of an apparatus for giving a signal, not only at the hour fixed, but also at equal intervals, is a matter of interest. The question of doing this has been solved in a very elegant way by Mr. Silas in the invention of the apparatus. It consists of a clock whose dial is provided with a series of small pins. The hands are insulated from the case and communicate with one of the poles of a pile contained in the box. The case is connected with the other pole. A small vibrating bell is interposed in the circuit. If it be desired to obtain a signal at a certain hour, the corresponding pin is inserted, and the hand upon touching this closes the circuit, and the bell rings. The bell is likewise inclosed within the box. There are two rows of pins--one of them for hours, and the other for minutes. They are spaced according to requirements.
