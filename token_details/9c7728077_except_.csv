Franz's father was a schoolmaster, and so was Franz himself for three years.He taught the little children of Vienna their A-B-C's, and how to do sums. Of course, he helped them to learn to read.Sometimes we find it quite hard to take one piano lesson or violin lesson a week.But from the time when Franz Schubert was a very little boy he had lessons every week for violin, voice, and piano.A little later he began to study harmony with a very famous man who knew Mozart. His name was Antonia SalieriWith so many lessons and with school work just as we have it, Franz must have been a very busy boy.He was quite poor and often very hungry; but in spite of that he was always good natured and full of fun.At eleven years of age he became a singer in the chapel of the Emperor. It was here that Salieri was director.
