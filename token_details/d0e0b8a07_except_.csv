First, doctors must determine what kind of stroke has occurred. This is important because each type of stroke requires a different treatment. Using brain scanning devices, doctors must determine whether a bleed or a blockage is causing the patients symptoms.If a blockage (ischemic stroke) is identified, the goal of treatment is to remove the blood clot. (That is why these treatments are called clot-busters!) Clot-busting medications are given to the patient to break down and dissolve the clot that is causing the blockage. Alternatively, surgery can be performed and a wire can be sent up into the blood vessel to pull the clot out.If a bleed (hemorrhagic stroke) is identified, the goal for treatment is to stop the bleeding and reduce pressure building up within the skull. A bleed is most commonly treated using medications to reduce blood pressure and bleeding in the brain. In some cases, surgery may be required to drill a hole in the skull and release the pressure on the brain. Another surgery option is to place a clasp around the broken part of the blood vessel to clamp it shut and stop the bleeding.
