Habitat fragmentation is currently recognized as one of the greatest threats to the survival of many of Earth's species, birds included. What is even more worrying is that humans benefit from the many vital services, called ecosystem services that birds provide. For example, many birds are important predators of "pest" species, such as mosquitos and rodents, and birds can also be pollinators of many plant species. In fact, one study found 33% of birds to be involved in spreading the seeds of plants that are medically and economically importance to humans. There are even some birds that are so critical to the functioning of the ecosystems they live in that, without them, these ecosystems fall apart. We call these critical species that hold ecosystems together keystone species.Unfortunately, as the human population continues to grow, so too does our demand for more houses and better roads. This has resulted in the widespread destruction and fragmentation of forests, which in turn threatens the survival of birds and the ecosystem services the birds provide us.
