After lunch away they ran in search of "specimens," by which they meant pretty stones. They chipped pieces off the rocks with hammers, playing they were miners finding gold and silver. They filled their baskets, and pretended to have made great fortunes.They kept up the sport until five o'clock, when their mammas said it was time to start for home, and counted the children to see if all were there. Only five could be found. There should have been six. Who was missing?It was four-year-old Willie. "Willie, Willie!" shouted every one, and from the great red rock came a faint reply. Then began "hide-and-seek" in earnest, and soon they spied the little fellow sitting on the side of the rock full five yards up."Why, Willie!" called his mamma. "What are you doing up there?""Going to climb through the little hole, mamma; but I'm tired."His uncle climbed after him, and soon brought him down.Six tired little children went early to bed that night, and dreamed of stony men and women, lions and bears.
