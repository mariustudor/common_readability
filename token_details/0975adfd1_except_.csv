The two young cruisers in the motor boat could not say a single word when these astounding words reached their ears.Meanwhile the other craft had drawn quickly nearer, and Jack could even make out the fact that the men crowded in her seemed to be in some sort of uniform, for he certainly discovered brass buttons.Then it was not a joke, nor yet some sort of trick being played by cunning river vagrants in order to catch the boys off their guard.Jimmie was rubbing his eyes, and muttering to himself, as though he began to believe he might be dreaming."Don't think of offering any resistance, you rascals!" continued the gruff voice in the nearby boat; "because we're ready to give you a volley. Take hold there, Grogan. Now aboard with you!"A couple of burly men came sliding into the natty little motor boat. Then lights flashed in the faces of the two astonished occupants."Say, they're a couple of boys, Cap!" exclaimed the man who had grasped hold of Jack, as the glow of his lantern illuminated the face of the skipper of the Tramp.
