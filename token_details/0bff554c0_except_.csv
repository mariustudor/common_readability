Then the king said to the young princess, ‘As you have given your word you must keep it; so go and let him in.' She did so, and the frog hopped into the room, and then straight on—tap, tap—plash, plash—from the bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where the princess sat. ‘Pray lift me upon chair,' said he to the princess, ‘and let me sit next to you.' As soon as she had done this, the frog said, ‘Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.' This she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, ‘Now I am tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.' And the princess, though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house. ‘Now, then,' thought the princess, ‘at last he is gone, and I shall be troubled with him no more.'
