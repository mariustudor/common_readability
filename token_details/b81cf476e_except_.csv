Once upon a time, there was a man who had three sons. The youngest son was the cleverest and his father liked him the most. Then the man realised that his two other sons were jealous. So when the father died, he left all his cattle to his two elder sons. He only left one ox for the youngest son. But the brothers were still jealous of him. One day they said, "We've got to slaughter your ox." He was the youngest so he couldn't protest. He said, "If that must be so, there's nothing I can do. But please give me the hide." When they slaughtered the ox, he took the hide. After drying it, he climbed a tree with it. As it got darker, a group of merchants came to sleep under the tree. In the middle of the night, the young man started beating the hide with a stick. When the stick hit the hide it sounded like thunder. The merchants thought that a storm was coming. They ran off leaving their goods behind. The young man picked up the goods and took them home to his brothers.
