"Are you satisfied now?" asked the Partridge."Well," returned the Jackal, "I confess you have given me a very good dinner; you have also made me laugh-and cry-ahem! But, after all, the great test of friendship is beyond you-you couldn't save my life!""Perhaps not," acquiesced the Partridge mournfully, "I am so small and weak. But it grows late, we should be getting home; and as it is a long way round by the ford, let us go across the river. My friend the Crocodile will carry us over."Accordingly they set off for the river, and the Crocodile kindly consented to carry them across, so they sat on his broad back and he ferried them over. But just as they were in the middle of the stream the Partridge remarked. "I believe the Crocodile intends to play us a trick. How awkward if he were to drop you into the water!""Awkward for you, too!" replied the Jackal, turning pale."Not at all! not at all! I have wings, you haven't."
