Have you heard about methane gas? Maybe the word methane is not familiar to you, but in fact, this gas is widely found in our daily lives, in our atmosphere, and in the solar system. Methane is a gas that is naturally produced in all kinds of environments, and it comes from the breakdown of organic (formerly living) materials. Methane gas is effective at trapping heat and it also burns very easily. So, methane is one of the most important fuels for humans. Additionally, the methane in the atmosphere helps regulate the climate on Earth. However, the amount of methane in the atmosphere has been steadily increasing for the past 200 years, which concerns the scientific community. Surprisingly, recent studies have indicated that levels of methane are regulated by tiny microbes. In this article, we encourage you to learn about the methane cycle, the microbes that make and eat methane, and why more research is needed on this gas.
