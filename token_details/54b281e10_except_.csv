Now, there was a man who was well off in the world, and who had three sons; the first was named Peter, and the second was named Paul. Peter and Paul thought themselves as wise as anybody in all the world, and their father thought as they did.As for the youngest son, he was named Boots. Nobody thought anything of him except that he was silly, for he did nothing but sit poking in the warm ashes all of the day.One morning Peter spoke up and said that he was going to the town to have a try at befooling the king, for it would be a fine thing to have a princess in the family. His father did not say no, for if anybody was wise enough to befool the king, Peter was the lad.So, after Peter had eaten a good breakfast, off he set for the town, right foot foremost. After a while he came to the king's house and — rap! tap! tap! — he knocked at the door.Well, what did he want?Oh! he would only like to have a try at befooling the king.
