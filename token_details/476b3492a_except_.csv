There was a girl named Ayanda. Ayanda was the only child of her parents. Her mother and father wanted to separate. Ayanda decided to run away from home. She went to the forest because she did not know where else to go. A wolf in the forest chased Ayanda, so she climbed a tree. The wolf tried to bite her, so she climbed higher. At the top of the tree, Ayanda saw the beautiful sun. She fell in love with the sun and decided to stay in the forest. Ayanda climbed the tree every day to talk to the sun. The sun became her family. One day, Ayanda saw a man under the tree. The man was her father. Ayanda came down from the tree and her father explained why he was there. He said, "Long before you were born, your mother and I would meet here. It is a special place." "Now I climb this tree to get peace when your mother and I fight," said Ayanda's father. After a while, Ayanda's mother also came to the forest. She came to make peace with Ayanda's father. This was their peace tree.
