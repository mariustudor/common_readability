Mrs. Shelby had gone on her visit, and Eliza stood in the verandah, rather dejectedly looking after the retreating carriage, when a hand was laid on her shoulder. She turned, and a bright smile lighted up her fine eyes."George, is it you? How you frightened me! Well; I am so glad you 's come! Missis is gone to spend the afternoon; so come into my little room, and we'll have the time all to ourselves."Saying this, she drew him into a neat little apartment opening on the verandah, where she generally sat at her sewing, within call of her mistress."How glad I am!—why don't you smile?—and look at Harry—how he grows." The boy stood shyly regarding his father through his curls, holding close to the skirts of his mother's dress. "Isn't he beautiful?" said Eliza, lifting his long curls and kissing him."I wish he'd never been born!" said George, bitterly. "I wish I'd never been born myself!"Surprised and frightened, Eliza sat down, leaned her head on her husband's shoulder, and burst into tears.
