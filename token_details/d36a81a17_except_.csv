Other families noticed how well the hill family lived. "It is a good life up in the hills," said the husband. "You should come there too." Soon the other families left the flat land and went up to the hills. Each family found a cave to live in, and felt warm and secure. Soon the children became very quick at climbing rocks, and finding fruit in the trees. They could swing in the branches almost as well as any monkey. Slowly, things began to change. The children talked less, and grunted more. Then the adults noticed that their noses were getting bigger and that they were growing more hair. Every time they looked at one another they saw that their teeth were longer. They started to walk on four legs. They became a new creature that no-one had seen before in that place. This was the creature which people now call the baboon.
