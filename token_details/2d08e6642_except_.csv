Science shows that hearing loss also affects cognitive skills (like thinking, learning, memory, or attention). Babies with hearing loss learn differently than babies who can hear. This is not because they are not smart or cannot do things other babies can do. It is because the world is different for them than it is for someone who can hear.In our study, we wanted to know if being born deaf affects visual processing. Visual processing is the way our brains understand what we see with our eyes. It is an important cognitive ability. By studying visual processing in deaf babies, we can learn more about how hearing loss affects how these babies learn and grow. To study visual processing, we used something called a habituation test. Habituation is a simple form of learning that comes from being exposed to something many times. When babies become habituated to something (like a toy), they lose interest in it. This means that their brains have processed all the information about that toy.
