Have you ever seen a herd of cows in the field? Every now and then you will notice a cow shaking her head. She tries to drive away the flies that pester her. But why do the flies zoom-zoom- zee around Cow's head? They say it started long, long ago in a far-off country. The country's queen was very rich and had a kind heart. One day she decided to arrange a huge banquet. All the animals were invited. The enormous tables were beautifully laden. Every table groaned under the delicacies, dishes full of meat, freshly baked bread, steaming vegetables and honey-sweet fruit. The animals smacked their lips when they saw the delicious food. "The largest animal at each table should sit at the head," the queen said. "It is his or her job to dish out the food." Cow shared a table with Sheep, Goat, Dog, Goose and Fly. Since Cow was the biggest, she started dishing out the food. Each animal received a big chunk of home-baked bread with grape jam and cheese. But because Fly was so small, Cow hardly noticed her. "Zoom! Zee! What about me? I'd also like something to eat, you see?" Fly grumbled.
