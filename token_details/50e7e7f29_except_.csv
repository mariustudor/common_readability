One early morning, Ekai was woken up by his mother. He was in a deep sleep and he could not wake up immediately. His mother kept calling him, "Ekai! Ekai-i-i." Ekai was very annoyed because that was unusual thing to him. His mother had prepared breakfast for him and warm water for bathing. Ekai woke up, took a bath and breakfast. Ekai's mother brought him new school uniform and a pair of black shoes with grey pair of socks. He was surprised to see his father holding a blue bag full of books. He knew that his time to start school had reached. Ekai and his father left the house. He waved to his mother and held his father's hand. They walked to the bus stop. They found a bus that was ready to leave. They boarded the bus. After a few minutes, they reached a place where there were many buildings and children.
