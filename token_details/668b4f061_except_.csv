Graça worked hard at school and as a teenager she received a gift that would change her life. It was a scholarship to attend a rich city school. She dreamed of becoming a teacher and using her education to educate others. She wanted the children of her beloved Mozambique to know reading and learning. She dreamed of a time when all children would go to school. Graça did her best in that city school and years later she was blessed again. It was another scholarship to attend a university in faraway Portugal. She met new friends, learned new languages and read a bounty of books. She realized her dream of becoming a teacher. All this made Graça very happy. There was only one thing that still made her sad. Back at home people were still not free. But now Graça had an education, skills, and hope. She also had friends who felt as she did about children's right to learn. She would use her knowledge and work with her friends. Together they would bring change to Mozambique.
