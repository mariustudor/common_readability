The children laughed again, and Mollie said: "Poor Mrs. Tomkins, I would look for a new house if I were you—you do have such meddlesome neighbors! Then she took the hen off, and Mrs. Tomkins picked up one of the kittens. "Mrs. Tomkins gave a sharp ‘m-i-e-o-u,'as if to say, ‘what do you think of that?'"The children's mama was sitting in the library reading when the old cat came in, with a kitten in her mouth. She put it softly down, went out, and soon returned with another. She kept on doing this until she had moved all her family of five kittens. Then she settled herself in a cozy corner, and looked at the lady, and purred in this way: "If you only knew how much trouble I have had with that bad old hen, you would let me and my children stay here."The lady laughed and said: "I will see what I can do for you."Just then the children came in and begged to have the kittens stay. So a new home was made for them in a box in the woodhouse.
