"When you want a thing done well, do it yourself," is an old saying, and a very good one; but it is not always possible or desirable to carry out this advice. Therefore it is sometimes better to adopt an amendment to this proverb, and make it read thus: "When you want a thing done well, do it yourself, or see it done."So thought Louis IX. of France, sometimes called St. Louis, because he was considered to be rather better than most people.Among his good qualities was kindness to the lower classes of his nation. He would go about, very plainly dressed, and attended by two or three courtiers, and visit people in their houses. He took an interest in their personal affairs, and when they were very needy, he would order bread and other food to be supplied to them. Of course, this made him a great favorite with these classes of his subjects, and they were glad not only to receive his bounty, but also to talk with him and tell him about their many troubles.
