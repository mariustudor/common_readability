This game may be played by four, six, or eight players. Two players toss up for the first choice of partners; the winner also has the right for his side to be "call" or to "reply."After sides are chosen, the winner of the toss consults with his side, and they decide whether they will "call" or "reply." "Call" is considered the better position.The game is played with a map of the United States made of perfectly plain pasteboard with each State a separate piece, and without names or marks of any kind on the pieces.This map should be large enough to have Rhode Island about one inch long, and the game should be played around a table with the sides named North, South, East, and West.The side which "calls" takes all of the States in a box.
