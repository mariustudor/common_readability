There were four lambs living in a house with their mother. Mother was on her way to the market. "You will open the door only when I say open the door, my children," she warned her lambs. Meanwhile, a fox was nearby and heard the mother. He went to the house and said, "My children, open the door." One of the lambs said, "No, that is not our mother's voice. Our mother's voice is soft." The fox was angry. The fox wanted to make his voice like the lambs' mother. He decided to eat butter. He went to a shopkeeper. "Give me some butter, or I will eat you," threatened the fox. The shopkeeper gave him butter. The fox went to the lambs and said, "My children, open the door." A lamb looked through the keyhole of the door and saw the black leg of the fox. "No, our mother's legs are red!" shouted the lamb. Fox was not successful. Fox thought of another way. This time he planned to paint his legs with pepper powder. He went to a miller. "Give me pepper powder, or I will eat you," the fox threatened. The miller gave him pepper powder.
