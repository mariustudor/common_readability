A hard bump to the head can cause traumatic brain injury (TBI). Doctors treat more than 2 million Americans with TBI every year. Common causes of TBI are car crashes or hitting your head. Some TBIs are severe and some are milder. All TBIs can have serious effects, which include bleeding, brain swelling, or tearing of the brain's connections. It is important for researchers to study TBI, so that they can find ways to help those with a brain injury to get better. With this common goal in mind, scientists around the world are researching TBI. People with TBI often come to hospitals or clinics and some become part of research studies. TBI researchers follow athletes and military service members, too, because their activities increase the risk of TBI. In this paper, we review different types of TBI studies. We also discuss the groups helping scientists. We will also tell you how you could become a future TBI researcher!
