For many people, talking is something that requires little effort. We rarely think about the complicated ways that the brain, jaw, tongue, lips, lungs, and vocal folds work together to produce speech. How might your life be different if it was difficult for you to say your name? For people who stutter, talking is not always easy. In this article, we will discuss what stuttering, a communication disorder or way of speaking that impacts a person's ability to smoothly link sounds and words together, is and why it is an invisible condition. We will also describe ways to support people who stutter.Stuttering is a communication disorder that affects the fluency, the ability to smoothly link words and sounds together in speech, of a person's speech, which means the ability to smoothly link sounds and words together. No one has perfectly fluent speech. We all produce disfluencies, breaks in fluent speech that are common among all speakers (or breaks in fluent speech), from time to time. For example, it is common to insert words like "um" into speech and to repeat words or phrases on occasion.
