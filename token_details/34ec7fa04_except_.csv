Once, just as the long, dark time that is at the end of each day came, Mama Hare said to Tiny Hare, who was at play,"Come in, now, it is time for bed. You know you must hide from Man, and Dog, and Hawk; but I must tell you that you are to hide from Cat, also.""Who is Cat?" said Tiny Hare."Cat is not so big as Dog. She has soft fur and two big wild eyes.""She is just like me," said Tiny Hare. "I have soft fur and big eyes; then Cat is just a Hare.""The very idea!" said Mama Hare. "You have not big wild eyes, and your tail is not long like Cat's. Cat is not good for a Hare to meet. She can run very fast, and she has a claw for each toe," and she gave Tiny Hare a wee bite.
