As she thought about her rainbow quest, Yana saw a green frog jumping in the bushes. She could not resist, she jumped around with the frog for a while. Then, checking the sky, she said goodbye to the frog. Yana went on her way in search for the end of the rainbow. She began to think about the rainbow's colors. In a flash, red came first to mind. She recalled the day her family almost had a bad accident because a driver didn't stop at a red light. Yana was thankful because no one was badly hurt, although they all had cuts and bruises. Everyone got a huge fright.After red, Yana thought of the color orange. She loved sweet oranges. Sweet, sour and bitter were the tastes she experienced while eating oranges. Thinking about a sour orange made Yana's mouth taste sour! Yuck! Do you know that taste?
