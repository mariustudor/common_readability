Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is most commonly caused by a hit to the head due to being tackled while playing sports, being involved in a car accident, or getting hit with a hard object. TBIs can range from mild to severe, with some people quickly returning to school sports and others suffering permanent brain damage. The consequences of TBIs are considered an invisible disability because they can occur in daily life, but the person does not outwardly appear to have a problem, since there is no need for a wheelchair, walker, or crutches. For example, someone who is recovering from a TBI may be dealing with subtle changes in mood, vision, and sensations in the legs.Since many TBI symptoms are not obvious, this can cause others to underestimate how severe TBI can be. People may think that someone who is blaming bad grades on an injury that occurred months ago is exaggerating. Another misconception is that people can recover from TBIs more quickly if they work harder in school or at physical therapy. This is not true, and if the TBI symptoms are serious enough, participating in therapy may be challenging.
