Sometimes, the parts of the brain necessary for using language are affected by serious health problems. Our brains need a lot of oxygen and nutrients to function. Oxygen and nutrients are brought to the brain by the blood, which runs through our arteries. Unfortunately, sometimes these arteries get clogged or break during strokes.The areas of the brain that no longer get blood flow after a stroke experience a lack of oxygen and nutrients, so the brain tissue ends up damaged and does not work as well as it used to. After enough time without oxygen and nutrients, these brain regions will die. In 2015, there were 613,148 stroke events in the EU, and that number is projected to increase to 819,771 in 2035. This is a huge number of people! You might even know someone who had a stroke, maybe a grandparent or older relative.
