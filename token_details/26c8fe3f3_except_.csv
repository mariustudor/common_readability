"Come in," invited Father and the boys, standing in a group watching the knob of the door turn slowly. As it opened silently they saw standing on the threshold a little, old woman, all bent over, a long black cape and hood covering her from head to foot. She carried a cane with a crook in it and leaned very heavily upon it as she walked.Muttering to herself she crossed the room and took a seat by the fire. Her coarse, gray hair fell in straggly locks about her face almost hiding it from view.Suddenly the lights went out, leaving the room in darkness, save for the firelight."Place the pot before me," she ordered, in a high, broken voice, shaking her stick at Fat."Yes, Ma'am," said Fat, hurrying to obey."She's got Fat scared to death," giggled Toad to Reddy.From under her cape she now took a small paper bag and poured the contents into the pot before her, then standing up she hobbled around it three times, waving her arms and humming a queer little tune. Soon a dull red light glowed from within the pot, getting brighter and brighter.
