When they reached the first piece of fatty meat, Hyena felt a jerk. One of Raven's tail feathers came off in his hand! Then there was another jerk, and another. Raven felt much lighter, and the ache in his tail was going. He sang: Raven's feathers, unpluck yourselves. Raven's feathers, unpluck yourselves. In response, Hyena sang the opposite: Raven's feathers hold on, don't unpluck yourselves. Raven's feathers hold on, don't unpluck yourselves.  Finally, the feathers could not hold Hyena anymore. He was in the middle of nowhere in the sky. He jumped onto the fatty meat thinking that as he ate, the fatty meat would hold him. But as he tried to hold and eat the 'meat', all he felt was moist cloud! By now he was falling fast. "Help, help!" he shouted. But no one could hear him. Raven was lost in the clouds. Hyena fell on the ground with a crash and lay silent for some minutes. He woke up howling in pain, with a broken leg and dark scars all over his body. From that day to now, Hyena limps and he has many scars on his body. He has never been able to fly.
