Once upon a time, there was a hungry jackal. He was walking around the bush looking for food. He came across a grapevine. He spotted a bunch of juicy ripe grapes hanging from a high branch. "Those look really delicious," he thought. He took a few steps back so that he could make his highest jump. The grapes were too high. Jackal fell on his back without even touching the bunch. Jackal got up and went further back from his starting spot. He ran, and almost got high enough. But he fell, even harder. He tried again and again. But he couldn't get to the grapes. He kept falling until his back was very sore. Finally, he gave up and walked away. He stopped and looked back at the grapes. He was hungrier than ever. "Those grapes look really sour anyway," he thought.
