Once upon a time in a mountainous African village there lived a famous blacksmith. The villagers called him Ratshipi - the man of iron and steel. Ratshipi was known by everyone in the village. Villagers went to his shop every morning to watch him work. He seemed to be able to make anything with his iron and steel. Kgosi Mogale, the village chief, heard about Ratshipi's work. He sent his servants to bring Ratshipi to the palace. Ratshipi was happy to hear that Kgosi Mogale wanted to see him. "I will be very happy to work for the chief," he said. So Ratshipi went to the palace. "Ratshipi, I have heard about your good work," said Kgosi Mogale. "I want you to do a very special task." "With your iron and steel, I want you to build a man who can walk, cry real tears and bleed real human blood." "Impossible!" thought Ratshipi. But no one could say no to the king in this village. Ratshipi could not sleep that night. How was he going to do this impossible task? He was very scared and very worried. Suddenly, Ratshipi remembered a wise old man Rapule. Perhaps he could help.
