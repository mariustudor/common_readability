Neuroethics is a field of study dedicated to understanding the ethical, legal, and social impact of research on and about the brain (i.e., neuro). Neuroethics also aims to better understand the brain processes that are involved in making decisions about what is right or wrong. Ultimately, research in neuroethics seeks to identify solutions to help neuroscience and society come together safely and with the best results.Research in neuroethics breaks down into four main areas of study. To provide a better understanding of each of these areas, we highlight four examples of neuroethics research from each of the four categories. The term cognitive enhancement refers to the improvement of thinking skills when there is not an inherent problem with thinking. Several medications have been created to help people with thinking problems improve their ability to concentrate and do better in school. Sometimes, however, healthy people also use these medications because they want to improve their memory or ability to learn as well. This is called cognitive enhancement, and neuroethicists have raised four concerns related to this practice.
