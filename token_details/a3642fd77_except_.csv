Kim was happy that she had found a summer job. "Let's go and visit Mom," she said. "She will be finished teaching by the time we get there." Kim held up a hand to hail a cab. A yellow cab screeched to a stop on the side of the street. "Where to?" asked the driver. Kim told him the address. They made it safely. Kim paid the driver. She and Kurt went in to see their mom. Mrs. Gunter gave Kim a big hug. Kurt snuck in between them so he could be part of the hug, too. Then Kim told her mom how they had spent the day. She told her mom how she had used math to help her get the job at the grocery. By the end of the story, Mrs. Gunter was beaming. "You see," she said. "I told you math would help you out one day." "I never dreamed I would have a job in a grocery," added Kim, "but I think it's going to be a good job for me." "It may not be the job of your dreams," said her mom.
