It was fortunate that the Bryants were there to take the initiative, for Mr. and Mrs. Maynard seemed incapable of action. Usually alert and energetic, they were so stunned at the thought of real disaster to Marjorie that they sat around helplessly inactive."Come with me, King," said Cousin Jack, going to the telephone in the library.Then he called up every house in Seacote where Marjorie could possibly have gone, and King helped by suggesting the names of acquaintances.But no one could give any news of the little girl; no one whom they asked had seen or heard of her that afternoon.Cousin Jack's face grew very white, and his features were drawn, as he said: "You stay here, Ed, with Helen and Ethel; King and I will go out for a bit. Come, King."Kingdon said nothing; he snatched up his cap and went along silently by Mr. Bryant's side, trying to keep up with his companion's long, swift strides.
