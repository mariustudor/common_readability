It was fast approaching the time when mamas and papas call children for clean ups. It was time for children to wave goodbye to friends. It was getting to the dreaded bedtime. The sun was not moving. He stubbornly remained rooted at the same spot. Normally the shadows would grow longer, the later it got. But on that day, the shadows did not grow any longer. The sun refused to go to bed. Below, children were still playing, laughing, skipping and jumping, although it was long past their playtime. Parents, being parents, looked with worry at their watches. They were puzzled. What should they do? The clocks showed it was past playtime, but the sun still stood at playtime! In faraway villages, parents were saying, "Children it is time for bed." And children, being children, responded, "But the sun is still shining brightly." Mammas and pappas looked at each other. Then they looked up to the sky and wondered, "Should we send our children to bed? It is late, but the sun is still at the midday spot."
