Other people arrived at the bus stop. They complained because the bus was late. "Where is the bus?" they asked. Ebei was worried. "We will not be able to go to town," he thought. "I will not be able to get my uniform." Some people gave up and went home. Ebei cried. He did not want to go. "We will wait a bit longer," said his mother. Suddenly, they heard a noise. They saw dust in the air. The bus was coming! But this bus was not blue. It was not big. It was red and small. The people did not want to get in this bus. "Get in! Get in!" shouted the driver. "We are very late today," he called. Ebei and his mother got in first. Soon everyone else got in the small red bus. Ebei looked out the window. He saw more people at the bus stop. Even more people were running to catch the bus.
