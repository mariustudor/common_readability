The reoccupation of Belgrade by the Serbians is one of those military feats which amount to historical phenomena. The Serbians not only contributed the greatest feat of the European war, as far as results are concerned, but won for themselves an immortal page in the world's history.Greece alone has to show an analogous achievement, although greater, when she expelled the Persian invasion.Only the achievements of Arhangelovatz, Ouzhitse, and Lazarevats can compare in a certain degree to the brilliancy of Marathon and Plateae. And the Serbian achievement appears all the more Hellenic if analogies are to be considered.The Serbians, until yesterday a little people, with an army almost insignificant in face of the masses of the Austrian columns, submissive in times of peace, in the face of the most oppressive demands of Austrian diplomacy—considered like all the small peoples to be living at the mercy of the great—when the hour of supreme defense for altars and hearths struck, and in the face of an enemy threatening to swallow their country, they arose, terrible in their vengeance, and repeated the feat of the routing of Goliath by their small but invincible power.
