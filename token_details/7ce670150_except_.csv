Pierre Latreille, a French zoologist, was the first to describe the kennel tick in 1806. Some decades later, the German scientist Carl Ludwig Koch studied these ticks too, and based on some of their characteristics he gave the scientific name Rhipicephalus sanguineus to this tick species. These ticks still have the same scientific name today. Because houses and kennels where the dogs live can frequently become infested, often with very high numbers of ticks, this tick species is often referred to as the kennel tick.The kennel tick is the most widespread tick in the world, but it is especially common in tropical and subtropical regions. In cooler regions, these ticks are more active from late spring to early autumn; however, in tropical and subtropical areas they are active over the entire year .Generally, kennel ticks are small, between 3 and 4.5 mm in length, with an elongated body and red-brown in color.
