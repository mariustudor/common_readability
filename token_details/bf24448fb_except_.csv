Anywhere there is a frontier, where there are new and hard conditions to be met, tasks to be done, you may find this Susan B. Anthony kind of womanliness.It is the homespun, dyed-in-the-wool brand, as distinguished from the boudoir, beauty-doctored brand.Let me show her to you in her rocking chair.It is not without determined effort and much expense of strenuosity that I can do it, for Susan B. Anthony is the liveliest girl of 85 that I ever pursued.Although eighty-five are her birthdays, she has not reached the chimney-corner age.You cannot say to yourself, when I have finished this, that and the other — attended to the more pressing affairs — I will drop in on Miss Anthony. She is 85, and sure to be at home.On the contrary, you will get up, as I did, earlier than your wont, and if you're wise and would save time and travel you will start before breakfast — as I did not, alas!
