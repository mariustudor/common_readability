An old duck wandered into the barn and caught sight of herself in the mirror. "There is another duck," she said. "I wonder who she is."And she walked toward the reflection. "She is rather friendly," the duck went on. "She is walking toward me. What large feet she has, but her feathers are very handsome."Just then she bumped into the mirror. "Goodness!" she cried; "if that duck isn't in a glass case! Why are you in there?""Well, you needn't answer if you don't want to," she said, walking away. "A glass case is a good place for you."Just then a pig came along, and nosing around, he came in front of the mirror."What are you doing here?" he asked, thinking he saw another pig. His nose hit the glass, and he stepped back."So you are in a glass pen," he said. "You are not very handsome, and your nose is not so long as mine; I cannot see why you should have a glass pen."And away he trotted to tell the other pigs about the very plain-looking pig.
