The young man and the young woman talked and laughed together as they went along. They seemed to be very good friends. But what became of the infant in the carriage?Poor child! She fell off the seat. Her head hung over the side of the carriage, just in front of the wheel, and there she lay shrieking for help.I could not hear her shrieks, for I was a mile away; but the sight was enough for me. I seized my trumpet. "Shipmate, ahoy!" I shouted to the sailor-chap.No answer. It was plain that the sailor-chap did not care in the slightest degree for that poor suffering child. Nobody offered to help her."Steer for the shore!" I said to my helmsman. "Bear down to the rescue!" We landed as soon as we could, but not without some delay, and when we reached the place it was too late. Nurse, carriage, sailor-chap, and all were gone.
