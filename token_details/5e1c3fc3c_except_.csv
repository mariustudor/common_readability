Creationism is the belief that the universe was created in the way described in religious books. According to Genesis, God directly created life from the nothingness that was before, by fixing the chaos that was. Other religions have different Creation myths. The first approach is known as creatio ex nihilo, which is the Latin name for creation from nothing. The idea that God created the world has been taught for thousands of years by writers such as Augustine of Hippo. Creationism as it is known today started in the 19th century by fundamentalist Protestants who were opposed to the theories that scientists began to put forward about geology and evolution. In the 20th century, creationist movements also started in Islam and Judaism. Creationists do not believe that all of today's living things came about from simple organisms changing or evolving slowly over time. They believe that life was created much as it is today, and that one form of life cannot change into another. While biologists and paleontologists say that fossils are different from the life we see today, and can be put into order to show changes over time.
