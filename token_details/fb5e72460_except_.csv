"Where are you going?" the snake asked Berhe. "I am crossing the river," replied Berhe. The snake asked, "Please let me cross the river with you because I can't do it on my own." Berhe was kind and answered, "Come, I will help you to cross the river." The snake climbed onto Berhe's head and they crossed the river. Berhe told the snake to get down. The snake refused, "I will not, I'm comfortable here." Berhe was worried. If he hit the snake with his stick, he would hurt his head. If he grabbed the snake, it would bite him. Berhe decided to get advice. He wanted hyena's opinion about the problem. "Good afternoon, hyena," said Berhe. "Good afternoon, how can I help you?" asked hyena. Berhe continued, "I know you are very fair, so I want you to judge us." Berhe explained what had happened with the snake, and asked hyena's opinion on the matter.
