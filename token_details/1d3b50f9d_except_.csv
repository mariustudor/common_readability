In the Jewish faith, after years of Hebrew and Torah1 study, 12 to 13-year-old boys and girls participate in a celebration. The ceremony for boys is called a bar mitzvah, and the ceremony for girls is called a bat mitzvah. This literally translates from Hebrew as "son" or "daughter of the commandments."Jewish historians and scholars offer many different theories on the origin of the ceremony. However, the ceremony rose in importance throughout the Jewish diaspora during the 18th and 19th centuries.While the Jewish faith has many different sects, boys usually become a bar mitzvah at the age of 13, and girls typically become a bat mitzvah at the age of 12 or 13, depending on the sect. For both boys and girls, the ceremony usually includes a service in a temple or synagogue. The bar or bat mitzvah (the boy or girl) then reads from the Torah, followed by a celebration with friends and family, as well as fellow congregants. The way a bar or bat mitzvah is celebrated varies within each congregation, community, or family.
