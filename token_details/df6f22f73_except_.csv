Likhutu was enticed by the aroma of the mandazi. He longed to buy some. One day, Likhutu went to the woman selling the mandazi. "Is there something I can do for you to earn a few mandazi?" he asked her. "Yes, you can watch my shop for me while I go to Chama Women's Group," replied the woman While the woman was away, Likhutu became tempted by the sizzling mandazi. He said to himself with relish, "I will eat as many as I can. And then I will keep some in my hat." Likhutu had not finished talking to himself when he saw the mandazi woman from afar. He stuffed his hat with mandazi straight from the boiling oil. Then he pulled the hat onto his head. Immediately, Likhutu began to twist his neck from the scalding mandazi. When the woman arrived, she was surprised to see him twisting vigorously. She asked, "Is anything wrong?" "Nothing is wrong!" declared Likhutu.He hurried away to his cousin's house. He found his cousin with visitors, so he sat outside to wait. Likhutu continued to twist his neck while he waited. When Likhutu's cousin saw him twisting his neck, he was puzzled.
