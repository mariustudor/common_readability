Once upon a time, there was a man called Byantaka who had a cow. Each day Byantaka grazed his cow. He also gave the cow water to drink, but Byantaka only had a very small pot for water. So, he went at his neighbor's home to borrow a bigger pot for water. His neighbor agreed to lend Byantaka his biggest clay pot saying, "My neighbor's problem is my problem." After a few days, Byantaka went to a potter and bought a small pot. He took it home. He put the small pot inside the big pot that he had borrowed from his neighbor. Then, he put the big pot, with the small pot inside it, on his head. He carried the big pot to the neighbor who loaned it to him. Byantaka told him, "I am returning your pot, it has reproduced." The neighbor was amazed that his pot had produced another pot. He praised Byantaka saying, "Your home is blessed." After a while, Byantaka went back to his neighbour to borrow the pot again. He did not have good intentions.
