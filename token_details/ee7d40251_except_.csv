We have frequent inquiries as to the best means of removing a gelatino-bromide negative from its glass support so that it can be used either as a direct or reversed negative, and it does not appear to be very generally known that about two years ago Mr. Plener described a method which answers well under all circumstances, whether a substratum has been used or not.If a negative is immersed in extremely dilute hydrofluoric acid contained in an ebonite dish, say half a teaspoonful to half a pint of water, the film very soon becomes loosened, and floats off the glass, this circumstance being due to the solvent action which the acid exercises upon the surface of the plate as soon as it has penetrated the film. If the floating film be now caught upon a plate which has been slightly waxed, and it is allowed to dry on this plate, it will become quite flat and free from wrinkles. To wax the plate, it should be held before the fire until it is moderately hot, after which it is rubbed over with a lump of wax, and the excess is polished off with a piece of flannel.
