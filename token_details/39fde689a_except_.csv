A woman with her baby went into the forest. She went to pick fruit. In the forest she found a tree with ripe fruit. She put down her sleeping baby and climbed the tree. An erotot from another community came by. He saw the baby. He was surprised. He asked himself, "Where is the mother?" He bent down. The sound of the chains on his neck woke the baby. He let the baby play with his chains. The baby laughed as he played. The woman looked down to see why the baby was laughing. She saw the stranger. She was so afraid that she dropped her bag of fruit. The erotot looked up. He said, "Don't be afraid. I'm only playing with your beautiful baby." So, the woman came down from the tree. The erotot took off one of his chains. He gave it to the baby. "Here is a gift for you," he said. "Go home with your baby. Tell your husband to move to a more peaceful village. Your baby has given me peace," said the erotot.
