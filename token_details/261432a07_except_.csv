A typical photograph is a motionless picture viewed from a single perspective. In the real world, however, when we view a scene we can move around and look at things from different angles. Leika the dog is sitting by a chair. We can sometimes see more of the chair than we can see of Leika, depending on our particular vantage point. How much our view of Leika is blocked by the chair depends on where we are standing. It is also important to note that we get a sense of depth in these pictures. In the photos, we can tell that the chair is (usually) closer to us than Leika, because it partially blocks our view of her. Knowing how close or far away things are partly depends upon our having binocular vision. Binocular vision means that our left and right eyes see things from slightly different viewpoints, because they are located on different sides of the face. This means that our brain has to merge together information from these two perspectives. This process is called stereopsis.
