Bhabhloo was a very, very naughty bear, loved by everyone in the jungle, but most of all, by his mother. But he was really very naughty. From early morning to nightfall, Bhabhloo would jump and play and run through the jungle and his mother would call after him."Bhabhloo, beta, don't be so naughty." "Bhabhloo, sit for a little while, rest a bit…" "Oh no, Bhabhloo, you'll get hurt, beta, be careful!" "Bhabhloo, it's late now, it's nighttime, go to sleep now, son…" Ma would keep trying to control Bhabhloo, and full-of-beans Bhabhloo would think of new things to do, not listening to a word his mother said. This is a story about just such a night. Ma was very tired. Who could blame her? She had been running after Bhabhloo and scolding him all over the jungle, all day long. But Bhabhloo was still too excited to sleep. His mind buzzed with questions.
