There lived a hunter who survived by trapping wild animals. For many days he did not trap any single animal. His family began to starve. Hunting was their main source of food. One morning he went to check his traps in the forest. He was lucky that day, one of his traps had caught a giraffe. He got very happy when he saw the giraffe. He celebrated that his family will get food. He said, "Let me carefully get the giraffe without losing much of its blood." "Let me cut the ankle tendons so that there is little blood." He crept slowly, with his spear aimed at the ankle tendons. To his disappointment, he missed the target. The spear cut the trap! The giraffe jumped and before it could get away, the hunter grabbed the tail. He was dragged away. He was dragged through the forest. He finally let go of the tail. He was left bruised in the thorny bushes. He struggled his way out of the thorny bush with injuries and went home miserably. His greed and foolishness had denied him food!
