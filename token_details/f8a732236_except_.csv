While Dande wondered how to punish Madola, a small black poisonous snake entered one of the gourds unnoticed. Afterwards, Dande sealed the gourds and left. Dande gave Madola one gourd expecting his pay. After tasting, Madola said, "Bring me another gourd and I will pay you." Dande ran for it. Dande brought the second gourd. He gave it to Madola saying, "Here is another gourd of sweet honey like the last one. Pay me now." Madola took the gourd but said in a cunning way, "There is no pay today. Wait for the end of the year." Dande was angry. Madola wanted to eat the honey. He put his finger in the gourd and was bitten. He cried, "I'm bitten! Help!" The snake disappeared unnoticed. All the workers ran away not knowing what had happened to their employer. A short while later, an ambulance arrived to take Madola to hospital.
