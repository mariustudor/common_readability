All living things respire or breathe while turning food into energy. Animals and humans eat food and breathe in oxygen to create energy and breathe out a gas called carbon dioxide. When we run, we breathe in and out much faster. Plants change the energy they get from the carbon dioxide taken in through their leaves from sunlight into oxygen. Living things respond to the outside world. We call this sensitivity. Humans make fires when they are cold. Plants wilt when they do not get water. Elephants swim in rivers when they are hot. Living things have babies to survive. Fish, frogs and birds lay eggs. Plants and trees produce seeds to make new plants and trees. Humans have babies. All living things eat food. Some animals eat grass, others eat meat. Vegetables need to be planted in soil and need sun and water to grow. Food gives us energy.
