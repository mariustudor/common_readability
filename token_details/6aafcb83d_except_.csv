And that birch sap contains sugar is known, the peasants of many countries, especially Russia, being well acquainted with the art of making birch wine by fermenting its saccharine juice.But I find no hourly or daily record of the amount of sugar-bearing sap which can be drawn from the birch, or from any tree, before it has acquired its great digesting or rather developing and transpiring apparatus--its leaf system. And I do not know of any extended chemical analysis of sap either of the birch, or other tree.Besides sugar, which is present in this sap to the extent of 616 grains--nearly an ounce and a half--per gallon, there are present a mere trace of mucilage; no starch; no tannin; 3½ grains per gallon of ammoniacal salts yielding 10 percent of nitrogen; 3 grains of albuminoid matter yielding 10 percent of nitrogen; a distinct trace of nitrites; 7.4 grains of nitrates containing 17 percent of nitrogen; no chlorides, or the merest trace; no sulphates; no sodium salts; a little of potassium salts; much phosphate and organic salts of calcium; and some similar magnesian compounds.
