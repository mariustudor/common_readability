The animals all agreed and immediately grabbed hoes, shovels and picks. They started digging a well. Hare had not come, but the other animals continued without him. They dug. And they dug. And they dug some more. And finally they hit water. When they struck water, Lion said, "Why did Hare not come to help? He will not drink from this water!" Later Hare came and saw the well. He said, "Hello?" But he heard nothing. So he went in and splashed around in the water for a while. The next day, when the animals came, they saw that their well was a big mess. The water was nothing but mud. They asked, "Who would do such a thing?" Someone said, "I bet it was Hare, because when we were digging the well he was nowhere to be found." The animals decided to leave a guard at the well. They chose Baboon to keep an eye on things. Hare came to the well that night, and said, "Hello?" And Baboon replied, "Hello!" So Hare came over to Baboon, saying "Try this!" Hare gave Baboon some honey. And Baboon let him take some water.
