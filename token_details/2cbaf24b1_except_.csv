The speckled hen walked all around the house, and saw the front-door open. So she walked right in, and went up stairs.She peeped into the front-chamber, pecked a little at the carpet, and clucked with surprise when she saw herself in the looking-glass.By and by she saw a wash-bowl standing on the top of the bureau. She thought this would make a nice place for a nest. So she flew up to see; but the bowl tipped over, and fell upon the floor.When the people came up stairs to see what was the matter, they found that the wash-bowl was all broken in pieces, and the hen had made her nest in the band-box in the corner of the room.They thought this a very saucy thing for a hen to do; but they did not drive her out: they waited to see what she would do next.By and by the hen came off, and flew up on the window-sill. Then she began to cackle very loud. I suppose she meant to say, "Go and look in the band-box."
