On the way, we saw our friends playing football. "Ah! Football!" I said. I wanted to play too. I said to Chuma, "Let's ask if we can play with them. I like playing football very much." Chuma replied, "Let us go to the shop first, then we can come to play." But I replied, "Let us play first! Grandmother will not allow us to return." We joined our friends to play. I was the goal keeper. The goal posts were made of two big stones. I worked hard to catch the ball. My friends were not able to score any goals. We played until the field was full of sand. Then we went to the shop. Grandmother's money was gone! I started to cry. Chuma shouted, "Stop crying. You wanted to play first." We returned home without salt or cooking oil. We were very dirty and worried.
