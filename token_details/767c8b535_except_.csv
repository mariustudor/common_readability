Chameli's mother had a lot of beautiful jewelry. One day, Chameli's mother showed her all the jewelry and also taught her their names. The next day Chameli secretly took out her mother's sirfhula (a head flower made of gold) and wore it. With the sirfhula on her head, she left for school. On her way, she met her friends Champa and Sohan. They were amazed to see the sirfool on her head. At school, Chameli was the center of attention. Everyone stared at her and talked about her. Nayantara composed a silly song: Look at this girl, who is that? Why, it's Chameli, in her Gorkha Hat! Teacher saw the sirfhula on Chameli's head but said nothing. In the class, Alka called to Chameli, "My elder sister has lots and lots of jewelry. You have only one piece, and it's not even yours. It's your mom's!"
