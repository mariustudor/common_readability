The child ran out of the house, and across the garden, and down to the woods as fast as her feet could carry her. As she hurried on, a red squirrel jumped across her path and the little girl said to him: "Red Squirrel, you don't have to work, do you? You may just play, and eat nuts from morning till night. Isn't that all?" "Not work!" chattered the red squirrel. "Why, I am working now, and I worked all day yesterday, and all of the day before. I have a family living in the old oak tree, and I must store away nuts for the winter. I have no time to stop and play." Just then a bee came buzzing by and the little girl said: "Little Bee, do you have any work to do?" "Work!" buzzed the bee. "Why, I am always working, gathering sweets and making the honeycomb for you. I have not time for play." The little girl walked along very slowly, for she was thinking, and she saw an ant, down in the path, carrying a very large crumb of bread. "That crumb of bread is too heavy for you, Ant," said the little girl.
