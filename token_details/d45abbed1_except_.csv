An Elephant and a Crocodile were once standing beside a river. They were disputing as to which was the better animal."Look at my strength," said the Elephant. "I can tear up a tree, roots and all, with my trunk.""Ah! But quantity is not quality, and your skin is not nearly so tough as mine," replied the Crocodile, "for neither spear, arrow, nor sword can pierce it."Just as they were coming to blows, a Lion happened to pass. "Heyday, sirs!" said His Majesty, going up to them, "let me know the cause of your quarrel.""Will you kindly tell us which is the better animal?" cried both at once."Certainly," said the Lion. "Do you see that soldier's steel helmet on yonder wall?" pointing at the same time across the river."Yes!" replied the beasts."Well, then," continued the Lion, "go and fetch it, and bring it to me, and I shall be able then to decide between you."Upon hearing this, off they started. The Crocodile, being used to the water, reached the opposite bank of the river first, and was not long in standing beside the wall. Here he waited till the Elephant came up.
