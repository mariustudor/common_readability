"I don't believe it is anything of any account," cried brother John. "She wants to keep us curious.""Well, I think Pansy must be learning a new piece to recite," said her mother."That's not it," said Pansy. "It's a 'portant secret: one that my mother will like to hear.""Oh, it's important, is it?" said papa. "I do wonder what it can be.""Mother, what day was it that you lost your wedding-ring?" said John."Don't speak of it, John. It was more than a month ago. I have hunted high and low, and cannot find it. I would have given all my other jewelry rather than have lost it."Here Pansy turned red in the face, got down from her high-chair, and ran out of the room."Did you see that?" said papa. "The little rogue has found the ring, and that's her 'portant secret."In a minute Pansy came back, holding up the ring, and her face radiant with delight. "I found it, mother, among my doll's things. You must have dropped it there when you were fixing them."And so little Pansy's secret was out at last!
