The clever Rabbit was awake inside his hutch. He was thinking, "I want to explore the outside world." The other rabbits were dozing. The door to their hutch opened. The farmer came in. It was meal time for the rabbits. The food smelled nice. All the other rabbits were awake now. They hopped closer to the farmer. The clever Rabbit watched the farmer walk out the hutch. "Aha! Now I know how I can sneak out. Tomorrow I must get out of here." "I'll hop into the basket when the farmer brings in food," the clever Rabbit thought.  The other rabbits quickly finished their meal and fell asleep. In the morning, the farmer brought in food for the rabbits. "Today is the day," the clever Rabbit thought to himself. "I must get out of this hutch."  As soon as the farmer put the basket down, the clever Rabbit quickly jumped in. No one saw him. After the farmer had fed the other rabbits, he carried the basket outside.
