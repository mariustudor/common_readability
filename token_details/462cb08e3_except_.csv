In the same town in which Sebastian was born there stands on the top of a hill a very famous castle built many hundreds of years ago.This castle is called the Wartburg.As a boy little Sebastian used to climb the hill with his friends, and they, no doubt, had a happy time playing about the castle grounds. In one of its great halls the minstrels of Germany held their Song Contests.When Sebastian was old enough he used to travel afoot, just as the minstrels did; his purpose was to go to hear fine organ players. Once as he sat weary by the roadside someone threw a herring to him so that he might eat as he rested.Little Sebastian's father was named Johan Ambrosius Bach. He, too, was a musician, as his people had been for many years.One of these was a miller who played and sang while the corn was grinding. His name was Veit Bach, and his little boy was called Hans, the Player, because he, too, loved to play the violin.
