There was once a very lazy boy. And when everybody else had planted out his paddy, he was only setting forth to plough. But the old man of the season, seeing him, said "The season has gone; what are you ploughing for now? The paddy is all planted out, and it is late." But the boy would not listen to him, and ploughed sturdily ahead, beating his cattle soundly as he went. And when the old man again and again questioned him, he cried, "What sort of old man is this? Can he not see that I am busy? I know very well what I am about." But the old man said gently, "Nay, my son: but it is for your good that I would speak to you."And the boy said "Speak quickly then, and have done with it." And the old man said, "My son, the season is gone; what avails it to plough now?" And then the boy cried "Where has it gone? And when has it gone? And why has it gone? And how shall I find it?" But the old man of the season said, "You should have ploughed when others did."
