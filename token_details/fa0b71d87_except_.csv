"Just wait a bit," said the bear, who was furious. "Never mind, grandfather; if you'll let me go you shall have a taste of my honey," said the fox.When the bear heard this he let go his hold and the fox jumped up on the stone after the honey."Over this nest," said Reynard, "I'll put a leaf, and in the leaf there is a hole, through which you can suck the honey." He then put the nest right up under the bear's nose, pulled away the leaf, jumped on to the stone, and began grinning and laughing; for there was neither honey nor honeycomb in the nest. It was a wasp's nest as big as a man's head, full of wasps, and out they swarmed and stung the bear in his eyes and ears and on his mouth and snout. He had so much to do with scratching them off him that he had no the to think of Reynard.Ever since the bear has been afraid of wasps.
