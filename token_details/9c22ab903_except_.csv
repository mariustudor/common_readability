I'm planting corn seeds for the new season. I must hurry. My parents' seeds have already sprouted. The bird flocks keep flying down to eat the seeds. The cats and I have to chase them away. "Flyaway, you bad birds!" we shout. A few days later, a single sprout shows up. I name it Green Top. I read books to Green Top so he will grow up quickly. When Green Top is thirsty, I water him. The cats and I play hide-and-seek with Green Top. I bring a new kind of food for Green Top. It is called fertilizer. Green Top grows every day. One day, I see the bees talking to the other plants. They say that corn is on its way! I quickly run to Green Top. My parents' plants are happy. Why is Green Top so sad? I ask his friends. "Does anyone know why Green Top is sad?" Snail doesn't. Caterpillar doesn't. Only Frog answers. He says ribbit ribbit and then jumps into the water. What does that mean? Oh! I get it! There's too much water around Green Top. I'll dig a trench, for the water to flow away.
