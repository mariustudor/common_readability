One day the children put the baby under a tree in the shade on a bright red blanket. They went to play. The baby began crying as usual. A group of cranes flew above the playground and felt sorry for the crying baby. They tried to get the children to notice that the baby was crying but the children kept on playing. The cranes decided to take the baby and raise it themselves. Four cranes came to pick up the baby from under the tree. Each crane took a corner of the baby's blanket, lifted the baby up and flew away. The children did not notice anything because they were busy playing. The children's parents were working hard in the hot sun. It was so hot that the mother decided to rest under a tree. While she was resting she heard her baby crying. She looked around and she could not see anything. Then she looked up and she saw four cranes flying away with her baby in the bright red blanket. She screamed and chased after the cranes. When the woman told her husband what she saw he did not believe her.
