Hare used to sit all day doing nothing and when Hyena came home after work, Hare would always ask him for nuts from his farm. But Hyena didn't like this very much. Hyena believes in working hard and not getting things for free. So, one day Hyena thought to himself, "Its so hard to work all day by myself. Maybe Hare could help me and in return he can get some nuts that he has actually worked for." Hare agreed to his terms and they shook hands on it because he thought it was a good deal. They also agreed that more work could be done and they will also get enough food for their families. The two worked so good together. They would work and laugh together. Hare would dig and plant and Hyena would help and sing along as they went. Hyena was very happy because he was able to plant a lot more than before. Hare was a really hard worker and worked all day long with no rest. He would work fast and faster. But he felt like he was working too much and wanted a raise because what Hyena was paying too little.
