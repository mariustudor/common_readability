Sinyaire village was surrounded by hills. Many snakes lived in the forest on those hills. The biggest snake was called Unyalego by the villagers. Unyalego scared many people. It swallowed whole goats and sheep. One day, three sisters, Apiyo, Ajoh and Atieno went to the forest to fetch firewood. The girls' grandmother warned, "Beware of Unyalego the big snake. Do not take anything from the forest except the wood." Only Ajoh did not pay attention to her grandmother. The girls packed milk, bananas, sweet potatoes and water. They took ropes for tying firewood and a sharp machete for chopping the wood. Then they left for the forest. On the way, the sisters chatted and laughed. Suddenly, Apiyo, the eldest of them, said, "Be quiet. We are coming to where Unyalego the snake lives." Atieno called to the others, "Look, here are Unyalego's golden teeth. Let us take them." Apiyo reminded them, "Don't forget grandmother's warning. We must not take anything from the forest except firewood." Ajoh said, "I don't trust grandmother. She said that to stop us having what we want. I want the golden teeth." Her sisters were worried, but Ajoh did not care.
