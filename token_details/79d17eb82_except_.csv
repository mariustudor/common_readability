"What happened to my spinach?" she demanded to know. Sipho was so scared that he could not talk. While they were standing in the garden, Thabo arrived. "Thabo, do you know anything about my spinach?" asked grandmother. "No, grandmother. I don't know anything about the spinach," replied Thabo. "Did you two boys leave the gate open? I told you never to leave it open." "No, grandmother!" said the boys with one voice. The two boys started to blame each other. They began to argue. Grandmother heard them arguing and called them. Grandmother asked them what they were arguing about. The boys told her the truth about the spinach. They admitted to grandmother that they had left the gate open. They were very sorry. Grandmother was very kind. In a calm voice she said, "I hope you two boys have learned your lesson. You must never leave the gate open again."
