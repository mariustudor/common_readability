The oldest hyena said, "Let the strongest hyena stand on the ground and then let the rest of us stand on each other's backs. We will climb on one another's backs until we reach the clouds." They agreed and started climbing up on one another's backs. Soon, there were no more hyenas left remaining on the ground except the strongest one. After the last hyena climbed up, the hyena on the ground thought that the others had started eating. He asked, "Why don't you give me some of the food you're eating?" However, the hyenas did not reach the clouds. They didn't find any food and so they had nothing to give to the strongest hyena standing on the ground. The strongest hyena became impatient and moved to the left side. All the others came falling down to the right side. As a result, even today all hyenas limp on their right side.
