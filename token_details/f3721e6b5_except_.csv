In the same instant, without a word to each other, Dave, Darrin, and Dalzell had done the same thing. That is, they started to run and at the same time doffed coats and vests, leaving these garments to flutter behind them.As they reached the sailboat both midshipmen cast off their shoes. Dave leaped into the boat while Dalzell threw off the bowline, then boarded.Like a flash both youngsters went at the lashings of the mainsail."There isn't a reef in," Dan discovered. "Going to take time for a close reef, Dave?""There isn't time," Darrin muttered, with drops of cold perspiration on his forehead as he toiled. "We'll have to go out under a full sail, Dan.""Great Scott!" muttered Dalzell."We may be too late to save any one as it is. There! Jump to the halyard.I've got the sheet."Dan and Dalzell began to hoist with a will. In an incredibly short time he had the sail hoisted all the way up, while Darrin, stern and whitefaced, crouched and braced himself by the tiller, gripping the sheet with his left hand.
