Environment is living things and what is around them. It includes physical, chemical and other natural forces. Living things do not simply exist in their environment. They constantly interact with it. Organisms change in response to conditions in their environment. In the environment there are interactions between plants, animals, soil, water, temperature, light, and other living and non-living things. The word 'environment' is used to talk about many things. People in different fields of knowledge (like history, geography or biology) use the word differently. An electromagnetic environment is the radio waves and other radiation and magnetic fields.
