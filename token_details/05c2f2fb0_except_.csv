The Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant in the United States was marred by many scandals, including Black Friday, corruption in the Department of the Interior, and the Whiskey Ring. (The Crédit Mobilier scandal, although exposed during his tenure, is not considered a Grant scandal.) Although Grant was not directly involved with these scandals, his associations with people of questionable character and his reliance on cronyism, nepotism, and political patronage gave rise to accusations of "Grantism".The term "Grantism" was originally coined by Senator Charles Sumner in a speech on May 31, 1872, a Presidential election year. It was used by Sumner to differentiate the Republican Party from Grant. The two men had been political enemies ever since Sumner's refusal to annex Santo Domingo to the United States. Sumner accused Grant of political patronage, nepotism, and being an autocrat like Julius Caesar.
