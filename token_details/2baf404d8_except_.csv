Have you heard of the Arctic? It is a place at the top of the world. Many animals live on the land and in the water there.One of these animals is the arctic wolf. It is a wolf with snowy white fur. Imagine that you are a wolf. What would your life be like?You would live with your mother, father, brothers and sisters in a group. This group is called a pack. Other wolves would live in the pack, too.You would like to play with your brothers and sisters. This would teach you how to hunt. Your pack would hunt together. You might hunt caribou, rabbits, and musk oxen.Your life would be hard. Hunting is dangerous. You might not be able to find food. Then you would be hungry.You would be cold and hungry during the winter. You would huddle with the other wolves to stay warm.But summer would be different. There would be plenty of animals to hunt. Then you could sleep in the warm sunlight with your packmates. Zzzzz…
