A brown little face, with whiskers. A grave round face, with the same twinkle in its eye that had first attracted his notice. Small neat ears and thick silky hair. It was the Water Rat! Then the two animals stood and regarded each other cautiously. "Hullo, Mole!" said the Water Rat. "Hullo, Rat!" said the Mole. "Would you like to come over?" enquired the Rat presently. "Oh, its all very well to TALK," said the Mole, rather pettishly, he being new to a river and riverside life and its ways.The rat said nothing, but stooped and unfastened a rope and hauled on it; then lightly stepped into a little boat which the mole had not observed. It was painted blue outside and white within, and was just the size for two animals; and the mole's whole heart went out to it at once, even though he did not yet fully understand its uses.
