Abike arrived at her grandmother's house. "What a lovely surprise Abike! Look at this new basket I made. Do you like it?" Grandma asked. "I like the colors, but the shapes are too sharp and pointed," replied Abike. How would you copy the pattern on the basket? Are the shapes like a square or a rectangle or another shape? On her way home, Abike lost the path. She wasn't sure where she was, so she sat down to rest under a tree. Abike stared at the leaves dancing on the branches above. There were patterns of light and shade all around her. Soon she fell into a deep sleep. When she woke up, she felt afraid. She wanted to be at home with her mother, resting on her mat. Just then a small, blue bird landed in the tree. "Hello, don't worry, I can help you get home. Follow me," it chirped. Abike was surprised to hear a bird talking. Abike followed the bird easily until they came to a fork in the path. The path split into two different directions, one to the left and one to the right. Which path should she take?
