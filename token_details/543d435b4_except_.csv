Despite the many benefits of using Agrobacterium to improve crop plants, some groups seek to prevent the use of genetic engineering, and even try to misinform the public about the approach. One of the most common misunderstandings about genetic engineering is the belief that changing the DNA of an organism is unnatural and therefore wrong. However, Agrobacterium has been modifying the DNA of plants long before humans learned how to do it. This shows us that changing DNA sequences is a natural process and part of the world around us. By using Agrobacterium to modify plant DNA, we are harnessing a natural process to develop crop plants that need fewer pesticides, are more nutritious, and that yield more food using less land. Using less land is a really important consideration because, if we want to avoid the destruction of natural ecosystems, we need to make sure that our farms are as productive as possible. Genetically engineered crop plants can definitely help us to grow more food from less land, meaning that more ecosystems will be protected.
