One day a Donkey told Little Half Chick about the Good King and his Animal Farm. Little Half Chick at once started hoppity-hop for Mother Hen and said,"Mother Hen, I am going to Madrid to see the Good King.""All right," said Mother Hen, "good luck to you."So Little Half Chick started off, hoppity-hop, hoppity-hop along the road to Madrid to see the Good King.Soon she met a Two-legged Cat going along hippity-hip, hippity-hip on her leg and crutch. The Cat said,"Hello, Little Half Chick, where are you going so fast?"Little Half Chick said, "I am going to Madrid to see the Good King.""May I go too?" said the Two-legged Cat."Yes," said Little Half Chick, "fall in behind."So the Cat fell in behind. Hoppity-hop, hoppity-hop went Little Half Chick. Hippity-hip, hippity-hip went the Two-legged Cat.
