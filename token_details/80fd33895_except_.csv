A situation is a "game" whenever (i) more than one person is making a decision and (ii) people's decisions impact one another.Just about everything we do in life is a game in the game-theory sense. At home, at school, everywhere we go, and just about everything we do, we are playing games. Do not believe me? Think back to the very beginning of your day, when you woke up. How quickly you got out of bed impacted your parents—and how early they woke you up impacted you—so that was a game! Think about what happened next, throughout the rest of the day. From the bathroom to the breakfast table, in the classroom and on the playground, you make choices that impact others as well as yourself. You're playing games! Knowing about game theory can help you improve your experience in those situations—not just to "win," but to improve your relationships and have a happier life.Game theory is used to study how people are likely to behave in strategic situations, with applications in economics, political science, business strategy, law, entrepreneurship, and military science, to name just a few.
