Long time ago, Hyena and Hare were great friends. They were both poor but Hare owned a donkey. He also had a very small basin, which he used to feed the donkey. One hot afternoon, Hare decided to give water to his donkey. However, Hare could not fetch water from the well with his small basin. So he decided to borrow a bigger basin from Hyena. Hyena gave Hare his basin because of their friendship. After getting water and giving it to the donkey, Hare went home with Hyena's basin. Two weeks later, Hyena wanted to wash clothes but Hare still had his basin. Hyena left the clothes and went to Hare's house for his basin. Hare gave Hyena his large basin. He also gave Hyena a small basin. Hare said, "Your basin gave birth to a young one and since we are friends, I am giving you the two of them." Hyena was happy and accepted the two basins. A few days later, Hare wanted to water his donkey and again he went to Hyena for help. Hyena thought, "Since I will get an extra basin, I will give him my basin straight away!"
