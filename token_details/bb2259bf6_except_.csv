When Lavender arrived, it was very quiet. He didn't see anything but a log floating in the water and a bird nearby. Suddenly, the log swallowed the bird! Oh! It wasn't a log after all. It was Gator. As usual, Gator was sitting like a statue, waiting for his prey. Lavender gulped in fear and quickly flew away home before anyone saw him. He sat in the trees, while he shook with fear, and thought, "Where's my house…oh yes! It's on the fourth tree. Ok, let me count then. One, two three, ten. Oh no! two, seven, five…No, I guess I am so afraid that I can't even count!" When Lavender's friend, Plum, noticed he hadn't yet come home, he went to look for him. He found him shaking with fear and so he asked, "Is there something scary around here?" Lavender shakily replied, "I never get scared, I'm just a little tired." Lavender doesn't want anyone to know that he's scared.
