A social networking service (also social networking site, SNS or social media) is an online platform that is used by people to build social networks or social relations with other people who share similar personal or career interests, activities, backgrounds or real-life connections. The variety of stand-alone and built-in social networking services available online in the 2010s introduces challenges of definition, but there are some common features: (1) social networking services are Web 2.0 Internet-based applications, (2) user-generated content (UGC) such as text posts, digital photos and videos, is the lifeblood of SNS organisms, (3) users create service-specific user profiles for the site or "app" that are designed and maintained by the SNS organization, and (4) social networking services facilitate the development of online social networks by connecting a user's profile with those of other individuals and/or groups. Most social network services are web-based and provide means for users to interact over the Internet, such as by e-mail and instant messaging and online forums.
