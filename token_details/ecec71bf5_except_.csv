Geometry is a kind of mathematics that studies the size, shapes, and positions of things. There are flat (2D) shapes and solid (3D) shapes in geometry. Squares, circles and triangles are some of the simplest shapes in flat geometry. Cubes, cylinders, cones and spheres are simple shapes in solid geometry.Geometry can be used to measure the area and perimeter of a flat shape. It can also be used to measure a solid shape's volume and surface area.Geometry can be used to calculate the size and shape of many things. For example, geometry can help people find:the surface area of a house, so they can buy the right amount of paintthe volume of a box, to see if it is big enough to hold a liter of foodthe area of a farm, so it can be divided into equal partsthe distance around the edge of a pond, to know how much fencing to buy.
