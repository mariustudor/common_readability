Shakespeare was an innovator of language. People quote his plays all of the time without realizing it. If you've ever heard someone say that "love is blind" or "all that glitters is not gold," they're quoting The Merchant of Venice. In fact, Shakespeare is credited with inventing over 1700 words and phrases. Do you know the joint that bends in the middle of your arm? Without Shakespeare, we wouldn't have the word for elbow!Not only has Shakespeare shaped the English language but he's also had a hand in almost every form of popular culture. From books to music to modern theatre, Shakespeare has served as an inspiration. The popular TV series Breaking Bad is in part inspired by Macbeth — just as House of Cards takes cues from Richard III, and the show Empire has been compared to King Lear.One reason his work has endured is because he wrote about universal themes. His storylines are dramatic and engaging. His dialogue is witty and poetic. He wrote tales of forbidden romance, of political intrigue, of murder and revenge. In their time, these plays were comparable to modern blockbusters.
