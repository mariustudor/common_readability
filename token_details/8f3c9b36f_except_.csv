Little Jojo and Tata Rectangle looked everywhere but they could not find the spring horn. "Go and see if Mama Triangle has the spring horn," said Tata Rectangle. Little Jojo stopped at his house to pour a glass of cold water. Jojo visited Dudu Diamond and asked if she would go with him. "It's not far but I will pack some food to take with," said Dudu. Dudu and Jojo stopped to eat and rest at the bottom of the triangle mountain. When they were halfway up the mountain, they saw a strange spider web. Jojo and Dudu arrived at Mama Triangle's house. "The chief did not leave his spring horn here," said Mama Triangle. Mama Triangle knew where they could find the spring horn. It was evening when they arrived at Chief Short and Round's house. Mama Triangle pointed at the chief. "You are wearing your spring horn on your head." Chief Short and Round gave Little Jojo the spring horn to blow. They were happy.
