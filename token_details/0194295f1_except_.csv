There was a boy who was named John. He lived with his grandparents in a village called Daveyton Village in Free State. John grew up. He took a walk around the village and he saw a crying baby. He rushed there called for help. The community of the village rushed to him and asked him what happened. John replied "I was taking a walk and I saw a crying baby." The community asked him again and they said "Do you know this child?" John replied "No I don't." Then the community leader took a baby to his home. The next day John was called to a community meeting of the unknown baby. John was asked to go to Faith the farmer and the settlers who lived nearby the river where the unknown baby was found. John agreed on that brilliant and clever idea.
