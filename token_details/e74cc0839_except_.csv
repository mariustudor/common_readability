There could be a snake." Maria laughs, "There are no snakes in the mango tree. Let's go up." So the two girls go up the tree. The two girls are in the mango tree playing. Then they hear a noise, Ssssssss. Maria is startled. "A snake! Let's run away," she cries. Maria and Naomi got such a fright that they fell out of the mango tree. The girls run. The snake might bite! Naomi asks, "Mother, please, kill the snake!" Mother explains, "Snakes bite only when they are frightened. There are dangerous snakes and others are harmless." Mother wants to know what the snake looks like. Maria and Naomi draw and explain. Mother tells the girls that this snake eats rats. It helps farmers. Naomi says that she is not afraid of the snake anymore. She goes close to the mango tree, and whispers, "Shuuu!" Naomi does not want to scare the snake.
