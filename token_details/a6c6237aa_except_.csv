Ekai keeps all sorts of animals in his father's homestead. His mother Mrs. Anok has always supported Ekai in the purchasing of the animals. Goats, chicken, chicks, cattle, rabbits and a dog are Ekai's favorite animals. During holidays Ekai with the help of his sister will take the goats out to graze in the nearby river banks, have fun and make sure all their livestock are satisfied. At the grazing banks Ekai would hold one of the goats after it has taken water confirming how the goats are growing fat each and every day. Ekai has a dog pet called Bony. Every time Ekai is around he would give Bony food and a hot shower with a shampoo, that makes Bony a happy and healthy dog. In the morning Ekai and his sister will give the birds food and water before he takes breakfast. Besides him Bony the dog would play and let no other wild birds to disturb their birds.
