One day when little George was seven years old his father set out by coach to visit another son, who was in the service of the Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels. The little boy begged his father to let him go on the journey. "No," he replied, "you are too young to go so far."However, when the coach set out George Frederick set out too on foot to follow, and he would not be sent home again.He kept on trudging along as fast as his little feet would go. Everyone hoped he would get tired and go back, but finally the father had to order the coach to stop and take him in. Thus, did he show that determination which helped him all his life.Arrived at the castle the boy soon made friends with the chapel musicians. They took him to the organ loft, where he played for them.All were delighted with his talent. One day the Duke himself heard him play. He, too, was astonished that one so young should show so much skill. Calling the father into his presence, he pointed out how wrong it was to deny the boy the right to study music.
