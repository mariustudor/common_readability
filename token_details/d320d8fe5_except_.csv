After searching through the house, Nellie ran out to the barn to look for the lost pet.Sure enough, there was the kitten, not taking the least care of her necktie, just ready to pounce upon a big mouse.Nellie's voice startled her so that she did not catch the mouse, after all. The nimble little rogue darted into a hole before kitty could even get her paw on his tail.But the cherry bow was still safe and unsoiled. So, after giving pussy a lecture on her disobedience, Nellie took her into the house.She met Belle at the door, and told her what a search she had made; while puss, cuddled in her arms, kept up a busy purring, as much as to say, "I'm sorry you were displeased with me. I really thought you would praise me for trying to catch that big mouse; for I'm not much more than a kitten yet."
