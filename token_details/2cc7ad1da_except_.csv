Han Chung ran for his father's axe, and Ho-Seen-Ko, his little sister, came out of the cottage with him. "Remember it is the Feast of Lanterns tonight, father," she said. "Don't fall asleep up on the mountain; we want you to come back and light them for us." She had a lantern in the shape of a fish, painted red and black and yellow, and Han Chung had got a big round one, all bright crimson, to carry in the procession; and, besides that, there were two large lanterns to be hung outside the cottage door as soon at it grew dark. Wang Chih was not likely to forget the Feast of Lanterns, for the children had talked of nothing else for a month, and he promised to come home as early as he could.
