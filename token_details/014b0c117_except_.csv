Therefore, we can conclude that only those parts of the brain that showed a huge difference between calculation and rest are important for calculation. fNIRS is a technique that allows the measurement of brain function, even in special groups, such as babies and children , and in real-life situations, such as the classroom. These capabilities make fNIRS very good for research. Educational Neuroscience uses techniques, such as fNIRS to study the brain and uses the results of brain studies to make education better in schools. While most of the commonly used brain techniques are great for studies in adults, they have several limitations when used in children, which is why we still do not know much about how the brain changes as we grow from babies to adults. Fortunately, fNIRS allows us to monitor brain changes and learning in children. We believe that using fNIRS in Educational Neuroscience will eventually help us to understand how children learn to read, write and calculate.
