the paper has the following advantages:First. The sensitive coating is regular, and its thickness is uniform throughout the entire surface of each sheet.Second. It can be exposed for a luminous impression in any kind of slide as usually constructed.Third. It can be developed and fixed as easily as a negative on glass.Fourth. The negative obtained dries quite flat on blotting paper.Fifth. The film which constitutes the negative can be detached or peeled from its support or backing easily and readily by the hand, without the assistance of any dissolving or other agent. Thus this invention does away with all sensitive preparations on glass, which latter is both a brittle and relatively heavy material, thus diminishing the bulk and weight of amateur and scientific photographers' luggage when traveling; it produces photographic negatives as fine and as transparent as those on glass, in so much that the film does not contain any grain; and, lastly, it admits of printing from either face of the film, as regards the production of positives on paper or other material, as well as plates for phototypy and photo-engraving, which latter processes require a negative to be reversed.
