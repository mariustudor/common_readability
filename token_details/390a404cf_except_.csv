It was in 1613 that our philosopher published at Rome another work, entitled "L'Istoria e Dimostrazione Intorno alle Macchie Solari." It was, generally speaking, well received, though he drew a conclusion in favour of the Earth's rotation on its axis.The controversy, however, became still keener on the all-important point of the interpretation of Scripture. Now that we can look back on the events of that day with all judicious calmness, we may well blame Galileo for having let himself fall into so dangerous a snare; but there was some excuse for him, attacked as he was on this very ground of the supposed incompatibility of his hypothesis with the teaching of Scripture; and so he unfortunately committed a grave error of judgment in grappling himself with a religious difficulty which, if wise, he would have left entirely to theologians. It may be said that this is not what we should naturally expect.
