Some moths lay eggs in clothing. Others lay them in dry food, like flour or rice. When the eggs hatch, the larvae will then eat the clothing or dried food. In the same way, larvae have damaged crops, trees and ornamental plants. Have you ever found strange holes in your clothes? They might have been made by a hungry moth larva!Humans use mothballs to keep moths out of their clothing. Mothballs are round, white balls treated with chemicals that poison moths. Since the poison may also harm humans, the balls should never be tasted or eaten. You should wash your hands immediately after touching mothballs.At the same time, moths also do things which help people. For example, moths help flowers grow by pollinating them. The downside of this is that the moths also lay their eggs in the leaves of the plant. When the eggs hatch into caterpillars, the munching of the plant begins! Have you ever seen the holes that caterpillars make as they chew on the leaves of plants?
