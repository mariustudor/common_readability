It is a hot Saturday morning on the farm. Maya, Duksie and Doobie are helping Mama K in her vegetable garden. The children work all morning. They dig compost into the soil. They weed and water the garden. Then, they harvest what is ripe. Today each of the children will take home freshly picked strawberries, spinach and carrots. Mama K always gives the children a treat for helping her. Sometimes the treat is cake, chocolate, or long sweets that look like snakes. Sometimes it's apples, pears, or oranges. Mama K has only one rule. "Share it fair!" The children know they must share the treats equally, so they all get the same amount. Today Mama K has baked a round strawberry cake with pink icing and berries from her garden. The children wait on the grass for their treat. "Here you go!" smiles Mama K. "But remember the rule that everyone must get the same. Share it fair! Don't fight!" Maya has the first turn to share the cake. She uses the knife to trace lines in the icing. The others watch her. She does not cut the cake yet. The others must first agree if her way is fair.
