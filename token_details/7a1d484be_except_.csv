More people came to the bus stop just before 9am. Half an hour later they are all still waiting. Sam is worried. "Maybe the bus broke down," he thinks. "Maybe we won't go to town today. Maybe I won't get my new school uniform." At 9:45am some people give up and go home. Sam starts to cry. "We will wait a bit longer," says his mother. Suddenly, they hear a noise. The bus is coming! The bus arrives at the stop at 10 o'clock. "Get in! Get in!" calls the driver. "We are very late today!" People get on the bus and sit down. The bus leaves the stop at 10:10am. "What time is the return bus this afternoon?" asks Sam's mother. "The blue bus leaves town at 2:30pm," replies the driver. Sam thinks, "We will get to town at 11 o'clock." "How much time will we have in town before the return bus?" wonders Sam.
