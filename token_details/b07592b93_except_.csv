During a drought, Yihdego left home to find a job. At that time, Tiebe was pregnant with their second child. After staying away for a long time, Yihdego decided to return to his home. Before starting his journey, he went to a wise old man for advice. After Yihdego greeted the old man, he said, "I have been away from my home and family for a long time. Now I want to go back. I need your blessing and advice." "Listen my son, on your journey home, do not use a shortcut. Do not comment on everything you see. Do not make a decision while you are angry," advised the old man. Yihdego set off on his journey. He met four merchants. They came to a cross- road. The merchants chose to go the short way. Yihdego remembered the old man's advice. He went the long way. The merchants who went the short way were robbed by bandits. After travelling the whole day, Yihdego arrived at a village. He asked many households if he could stay the night, but all refused. A man told him, "We don't allow strangers to stay in our houses but ask over there."
