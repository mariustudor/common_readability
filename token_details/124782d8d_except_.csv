The tortoise moved quite slowly.  She was never be able to collect enough tree branches to build a proper house. She sat down and thought about what to do.  After thinking for a long time, she decided to go in search of a house that was already built. One day, she saw a cave. She peered inside. It looked warm and dry!  But the cave belonged to a rabbit and her children. She climbed up a tree. But, she was chased away by birds chirping and cawing noisily in their nests.  The tortoise walked away sadly, sweating in the heat of the sun. One day, as the tortoise was wandering about, she found a cow in its pen. She was with her calves.  "Can I join you, please?" asked Tortoise.  "I'm sorry," said the cow, "but we can't help you. It's full in here already."
