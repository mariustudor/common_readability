One day his mother asked him, "Where do you learn these songs from, Sakima?" Sakima answered, "I just know them, mother. I hear them in my mind and then I sing." Sakima liked to sing for his little sister, especially, if she felt hungry. His sister would listen to him singing his favorite song. She would sway to the soothing tune. "Can you sing it again and again, Sakima," his sister would beg him. Sakima would accept and sing it over and over again. One evening when his parents returned home, they were very quiet. Sakima knew that there was something wrong. "What is wrong, mother, father?" Sakima asked. Sakima learned that the rich man's son was missing. The man was very sad and lonely. "I can sing for him. He might be happy again," Sakima told his parents. But his parents dismissed him. "He is very rich. You are only a blind boy. Do you think your song will help him?" However, Sakima did not give up. His little sister supported him. She said, "Sakima's songs soothe me when I am hungry. They will soothe the rich man too."
