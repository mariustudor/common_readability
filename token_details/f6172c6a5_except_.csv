In a system of arc lighting, however, we have to deal with entirely different conditions; for, while in the incandescent system the adding of a lamp, which diminishes the resistance, requires no increase of electromotive force, the contrary is the case in the arc light system. Here every additional lamp added to the circuit means an increase in resistance, and consequent increase in electromotive force or potential. Taking for example a well known system of arc lighting, we find that the lamps require individually an electromotive force of 40 volts with a current of 10 amperes. In other words, the difference in potential at the two terminals of every such lamp is 40 volts. Consequently, if the circuit were touched in two places, including between them only one lamp, no injurious effects would ensue. If we touch the circuit so as to include two lamps between us, the effect would be greater, since the potential between those two points is 2 x 40 volts.
