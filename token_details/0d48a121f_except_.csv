Junior felt so sad and misunderstood and thought to himself, "I'll run away to a place where no one will take away my things and I can do what I want. But just where should I go?" Then he got an idea. He'll run away to space. How? In a space ship that will take him up and away from Earth's gravity and everyone that is upset with him. He won't find this space ship in any showroom or a garage. As a matter of fact, Junior will just have to make it himself. He ran to the kitchen and attic, collecting any metal items that he could find. He gathered pots, utensils and other scraps - even an old television antenna! He glued everything together until it was finally secure and ready for take off. He thought, "Now, to break through Earth's gravitional field, I'll have to accelerate at sixty thousand kilometres per second. How could I possibly do that?"
