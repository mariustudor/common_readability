Abula stole his mother's money to buy sweets. Even when she hid her money, he found it and took it. After eating all his sweets, Abula would play with his friends. After a while, Abula stopped going to school. He stayed out playing the whole day, only returning home in the evening. Abula's mother noticed this and became worried. "Our son is not behaving well. I do not think he is attending school. He is also stealing money from me," said Abula's mother. He said to his wife, "Next time, hide the money within the pages of a book. He never even opens a book, so the money will be safe there." The next day, Abula looked for his mother's money. He searched everywhere but he did not find anything. He decided to go to the nearest market to find some money.
