If you snorkel or dive in the Red Sea, you will see large, colorful rocks surrounded by different types of fish. These amazing structures are actually not rocks—they are animals called corals and they build coral reefs. Yes, they are animals! These animals do not live alone, instead they live with tiny plant cells inside them and many other microbes, such as bacteria and viruses. Coral animals and their friends are in danger, because the water temperature is getting higher and because humans throw their trash into the oceans. Did you know that corals can be ill and have diseases, just like human beings? Many coral diseases have been described. One of these coral diseases is called black band disease (BBD). This article will explain what BBD is, what causes it, and how we can help corals to be healthier.
