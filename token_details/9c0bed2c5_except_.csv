Vusi looked at the photograph and quickly answered, "Heptagon has seven sides!" Khosi added, "Yes, remember our teacher told us that Hepta means 'seven'." "Oh my wife, can you see how clever our children are? Okay, what about Deca, what does it mean?" questioned Dad. "Ten! Ten!" shouted Vusi and Khosi together. "Yes, that's why one of your cousins is called Decagon, but he is not coming because he has to represent the swimming team. There are so few Decagons at their school," Mom told them. Then the children asked, "Mom and Dad, can we invite our friend Circle from next door?" Their parents agreed that Circle was welcome to join the family gathering. Just then they heard a knock at the front door, and Dad got up to check. "The Quadrilaterals are here! Welcome! Welcome" called Dad. The rest of the family jump up to greet Square, Rectangle and the three Rhombus children. The Quadrilaterals are happy to arrive first.
