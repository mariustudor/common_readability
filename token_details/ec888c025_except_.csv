It was on a Saturday evening while watching our family's favourite programme, that we saw breaking news of presidential briefing, that we all became courious and attentive. The President announced that there has been reported one case of a Kenyan who tested positive of Covid-19, a respiratory disease which was first discovered in Wuhan in China. It is rapidly spreading all over the world. He announced the closure of schools, churches and mosques, and all public gathering put on halt with immediate effect. I became very sad with the news and decided to visit the library on Monday, little did I know that it was a public place where the disease can spread rapidly and therefore it was also closed. I decided to go back home and study there. The ministry of health said that there is no vaccine had been found yet and scientists all over the world are working round the clock to get the cure for Covid-19. The disease is affecting all ages, colours, and races. Anyone tested positive for coronavirus is isolated in hospital for treatment and observation. All his contacts are traced and isolated for 14 days and later tested.
