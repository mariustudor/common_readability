At the recent Medical Congress in London, Professor Klebs undertook to answer the question: "Are there specific organized causes of disease?"A short historical review of the various opinions of mankind as to the origin of disease led, the speaker thought, to the presumption that these causes were specific and organized.If we now, he said, consider the present state of this question, the three following points of view present themselves as those from which the subject may be regarded:I.--We have to inquire whether the lower organisms, which are found in the diseased body, may arise there spontaneously; or whether even they may be regarded as regular constituents of the body.II.--The morphological relations of these organisms have to be investigated, and their specific nature in the different morbid processes has to be determined.III.--We have to inquire into their biological relations, their development inside and outside the body, and the conditions under which they are able to penetrate into the body, and there to set up disease.
