Near the top of the world is land called tundra. The tundra is flat and has no trees. It is covered by snow and ice most of the year. In the spring, the snow and ice melt. Beneath the ground, the soil stays frozen. The ground gets very soggy. It is a marsh.Small yellow flowers grow from the cold, wet ground. They are called marsh marigolds.Flies hide in the flowers. They soak up the Sun’s energy and get warm.The flies fly from flower to flower. They help the flowers make seeds.Caribou eat the flowers. The caribou also give the plants the nutrients they need to grow.Mother flies lay their eggs inside the caribou’s nose. It is warm there. The young flies eat and grow.The young flies get bigger. AH-CHOO! The caribou sneezes. The flies land on the ground. Soon, they will be adults.These plants and animals need each other. Can you think of others?
