One day Betty's father said, "Let us go to town tomorrow. President Washington is passing through the South, and a man told me today that he will be in Salisbury tomorrow.""Yes," said Betty's brother Robert, "and our company has been asked to march in the parade. One of the boys is going to make a speech of welcome.""I should like to go," said their mother, "but I can't leave home.""Oh, yes, you can, mother," said Betty. "I have stayed here by myself many times, and I can stay tomorrow. You go with father, and I will take care of things."The next morning every one on the place was up before the sun. Robert was so impatient to start to town that he could scarcely eat any breakfast. Mother was so excited that she forgot to put coffee in the coffee pot.At last every one had left, and Betty was alone. "I wish I could see the President," she said, "and I do wish I could see his great coach. Father says that it is finer than the Governor's."
