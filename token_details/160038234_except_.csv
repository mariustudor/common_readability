When the lads reached home they told their plan to Willie's sister Matie, and then all three determined to carry it out."Rap-a-tap, tap," sounded briskly at the library door after supper. "Come in," was the response, and in bounded the three children, their faces lighted up with smiles at the prospect of spending an evening with Uncle Jack."Welcome, youngsters," said he, in a cheery tone. "But you look as if you were expecting something; what is it?""Oh, Uncle Jack, we want you to tell us all about pottery," cried the boys."Yes, please do," chimed in Matie."All about pottery? Why, my dear children, that's very like asking me to tell you all about the whole world, for a complete history of one would be almost a history of the other; and I could hardly do that, you know," said Uncle Jack, with a smile."Willie said you could talk about pottery all night," cried Matie."And so I might, dear, and not get further than the ABC of its history, after all," answered Uncle Jack.
