Volcanologists study the personality of volcanoes because this information can determine how far from the volcanoes the eruptions will have an impact—remember rocks from the Phlegrean fields were found 4,000 km away! Now, we will tell you about the different hazards associated with volcanic eruptions.When a volcano erupts explosively, the magma cools and is turned into volcanic ash and gases, like carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). The ash travels so fast that it is injected far into the atmosphere, as high as planes can travel. Volcanic ash can stop planes from flying, because ash is bad for their engines. Volcanic ash and gas from large eruptions can travel in the atmosphere all around the Earth, changing the climate. Volcanic gases form aerosols (mixture of fine particles) in the atmosphere that reflect the solar radiation back to space and lead to global cooling. In fact, one eruption in Indonesia in 1815 caused a year without a summer in Europe and North America in 1816.
