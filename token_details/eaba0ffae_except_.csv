In a particular year, the dry season was too long, and a drought hit hard. As a result, all the rivers dried up, except the River of Blessings. All the animals were thirsty and called for a meeting. Camel was the first to speak, "As you know, we are very thirsty and all the rivers have dried up, except the River of Blessings. But it is very far away. What do we do?" Horse suggested, "Some of us can go to the River of Blessings. We can drink and bring water for the others." Cow answered, "It is too far. By the time we returned from the river those left behind would be dead." Sheep said, "Maa! Maaa! I will go to the River of Blessings and drink water." Goat jumped up and said, "Meee, meee! I will also go to the River of Blessings." Chicken said, "Keer, ker ker ker! I too will go to the River of Blessings. All the animals wanted to go. Camel led the way. Going there was not easy. Guinea fowl was last in the line. "My friends, I can no longer go to the River of Blessings," he said.
