Long, long, time ago, all the animals could talk. Mother Mosquito and Baby Mosquito lived in a house. Mother Mosquito always left Baby Mosquito at home when she went to search for food. One day, after Mother left the house, Baby Mosquito decided to see what was happening outside. Later that day, Mother Mosquito came back and found that Baby Mosquito was gone. Mother Mosquito started to panic! She was worried and was going to search for Baby Mosquito. Just then, Baby Mosquito arrived, very excited. "Mummy, the humans were so happy to see me. They clapped their hands every time I flew past!" Mother Mosquito was alarmed. "You say that people were happy and clapping their hands for you?" "No, those people were not happy to see you. They were trying to kill you!" explained Mother. "Humans are never friends with mosquitoes," she warned.
