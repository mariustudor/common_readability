Our findings support our prediction that individuals with damage to the LTP would be able to recognize famous musical songs, but not name them. These findings help show that the LTP is a critical region for naming proper nouns of various types, including famous faces, landmarks, and now, songs. Without this brain region, people are impaired at naming unique items. This shows us that the LTP is an important brain region for naming proper items. The LTP is called a "convergence zone" for naming items. What this means is that the LTP does not store the names of the items, but it is a region where the names of items are related to the information about the items. This explains why people with LTP damage are able to say information about the item but not the name. So, next time you hear a song on the radio and think of its name, remember that you are using your LTP!
