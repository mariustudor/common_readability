George is never so happy as when he is on Grandpa's knee; and the first thing that Grandpa has to do, when little George is seated there, is to pull out his watch."Watch, watch!" cries little George; and Grandpa takes it out, opens it, and lets him see all the queer little wheels and the bright works, that shine and glitter so, and keep up the quick movements, and make the watch say, "Tick, tick!"Grandpa and George are good friends, because Grandpa tries to explain things to him. One day he brought home a watch and gave it to the little boy for his own, and showed him how to wind it up, and make it tick.George is very proud of it, and will soon learn to tell the time of day. He knows now how to count ten.
