When the Little Colonel reached the hotel, the omnibus was leaving the door to go to the railroad station, a few blocks away. Thinking that Betty and Eugenia might be on the coming train, she went into the parlor to wait for the return of the omnibus. She had bought a box of chocolate creams at the cake shop on the corner to divide with Hero.Fidelia had wandered down to the parlor in her absence, and now seated at the old piano was banging on its yellow keys with all her might. She played unusually well for a girl of her age, but Lloyd had a feeling that a public parlor was not a place to show off one's accomplishments, and her nose went up a trifle scornfully as she entered.Then she caught sight of herself in the mirror over the mantel, and her expression changed instantly.
