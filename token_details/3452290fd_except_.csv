Chanri and Boipelo are going on an adventure around South Africa. Their journey starts in Kimberley, in the Northern Cape. In Kimberley you will find the Big Hole! Tjoeke puff toot-toot, they travel to Cape Town in the Western Cape. Chanri and Boipelo pick juicy grapes at the farms. Tjoeke puff toot-toot, then they head off to Bhisho, in the Eastern Cape. The two friends have fun at the Elephant Park! Tjoeke puff toot-toot, they pass through the Free State. They admire all the pretty roses blooming in Bloemfontein. On to Mahikeng, in the North West. The train slows down to meet Rina the rhino at the National Park. Then our friends speed on to Polokwane, in Limpopo. Toot-toot toot-toot! They're running late, so the train doesn't stop in Johannesburg, Gauteng. From the train they see many cars and people in this busy city of gold.
