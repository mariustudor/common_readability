There was a king long ago in Ireland. He had three sons, and one of them was something silly. There came a sickness on the king, and he called his three sons. He said to them that he had knowledge the only thing would cure him was the apples from Burnett's orchard. So he bade them to go look for them, for that orchard was in some far-away place, and no one could tell where it was.The three sons went then, and they caught their horses, put on their bridles, set out, and went on till they came to three crossroads. They went on till they came to three crossroads. There they stopped, and they settled among themselves that each one of them would take one of the roads and go searching for the apples, and they would meet at the same place at the end of a year and a day.
