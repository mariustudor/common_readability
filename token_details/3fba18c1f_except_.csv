March 4th, William McKinley was duly inaugurated as Chief Officer of our country.For once the weather was perfect, and everybody was in the best of good humor, and up early to see the sights. At about ten o'clock Major McKinley was escorted from his hotel to the White House by a company of soldiers.Here he was received by Mr. Cleveland, who up to the very last moment was busy writing and attending to the final duties of his office.The members of Mr. Cleveland's Cabinet also came to pay their respects to the President-elect. After the greetings were over, Mr. Cleveland and Major McKinley walked out on the porch side by side, ready to make their journey to the Capitol.As they passed down the steps through the crowd that was waiting to see them, every hat came off, and the spectators stood bareheaded as the two most important men in the country passed before them.The state carriage, drawn by four horses, was waiting for them; stepping into it, they started on their trip to the Capitol.
