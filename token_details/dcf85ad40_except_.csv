Kadogo and Juma are friends who love running. They run together every day. One day they were reading maps at school. Juma said, "Let's run across our continent. Let's race, together with Africans from many countries!" "Let's go, we can do it! African unity!" cheered Kadogo. They decided to carry a unity torch on their journey. They lit the torch and began to run. The race started at the southern tip of our continent, in Cape Town, South Africa. From South Africa they headed along the west coast. They ran through Namibia, Angola, DRC, Congo and Cameroon. Runners quickly joined them from these countries. The growing group of people rested in Nigeria, in Abuja. More runners from West Africa joined the friends as they passed through Nigeria. They continued together, following the River Niger. A sandstorm in Mali made it difficult to run. Juma was the strongest of all of them. He led the way safely, holding the unity torch high. At Guinea's coast in Conakry the dusty runners washed in the sea. Then they decided to race to Morocco through Senegal and Mauritania. All the way, more people joined them.
