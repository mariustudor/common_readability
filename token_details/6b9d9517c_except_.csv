Among the most subtle and skillful of all the women spies was Baroness de Kaula. During the Franco-Prussian war the French General de Cissy was taken prisoner by the Germans. During his sojourn in Germany Baroness de Kaula and he became very intimate and the young woman, a Levantine by birth, wormed herself into his confidence. After peace was restored Gen. de Cissy returned to Paris, where he soon became a great factor in the reconstruction of the French army. In 1875 he was Minister of War and great things were expected for the "Armee de la Revanche." At the command of Bismarck Baroness de Kaula received her instructions from Dr. Stieber and was ordered to rejoin the old French General in Paris. Unsuspectingly flattered, Gen. de Cissy welcomed her. The Baroness was installed in a private apartment where the old General came every day after breakfast to listen to her beautiful playing of the piano or to give an opinion on her newest French poem. Baroness de Kaula was a poet, an artist and a musician.
