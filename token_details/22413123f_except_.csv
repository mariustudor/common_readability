One morning, bright and early, a sheep and a curly-tailed pig started out through the world to find a home. For the thing they both wanted more than anything was a house of their own. "We will build us a house," said the sheep and the curly-tailed pig, "and there we will live together." So they traveled a long, long way, over the fields, and down the lanes, and past the orchards, and through the woods, until they came, all at once, upon a rabbit. "Where are you going?" asked the rabbit of the two. "We are going to build us a house," said the sheep and the pig. "May I live with you?" asked the rabbit. "What can you do to help?" asked the sheep and the pig. The rabbit scratched his leg with his left hind foot for a minute, and then he said: "I can gnaw pegs with my sharp teeth; I can put them in with my paws." "Good!" said the sheep and the pig; "you may come with us."
