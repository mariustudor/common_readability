We set out in a little boat, hoping for a BIG adventure! When we reached the dive site, we carefully checked all our equipment and put on our fins and masks. As soon as we were underwater, we were greeted by a school of yellowback fusiliers. There were so many different creatures to see around this large table coral: oriental sweetlips, parrotfish, batfish, and even a beautifully-patterned nudibranch. This trumpetfish changed colour to try and blend in with a school of yellow tang, but you can pick him out easily enough, can't you? It's a good thing we kept a safe distance from this lionfish. The spines on his back can be quite poisonous! These clownfish carefully guarded their sea anemone home, but finally agreed to let me take a few pictures. We saw a honeycomb moray eel having its teeth cleaned by cleaner wrasses, and another pair even offered to give us a scrub!
