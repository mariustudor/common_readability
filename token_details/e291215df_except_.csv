The coach put his hands on his hips. "At this school, only boys are allowed to play soccer," he said. The boys told her to go and play netball. They said that netball is for girls and soccer is for boys. Andiswa was upset. The next day, the school had a big soccer match. The coach was worried because his best player was sick and could not play. Andiswa begged the coach, "Please, let me play." The coach was not sure what to do. Then he decided that Andiswa could join the team. The game was tough. Nobody had scored a goal by half time. During the second half of the match, Andiswa got the ball. She moved very fast towards the goal post. Andiswa kicked the ball hard and scored a goal. The crowd went wild with joy. Since that day, girls were also allowed to play soccer at the school.
