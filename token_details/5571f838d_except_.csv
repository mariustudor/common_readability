We now know that exercise can be a really important part of care for people living with short- and long-term mental illness. Exercise can improve mood and reduce symptoms of mental illness, including depression and anxiety. Exercise can also improve sleep quality, increase energy levels and reduce stress. Exercise has also been shown to increase self-confidence and improve both memory and concentration. Plus, exercise offers all these benefits without the risk of serious side-effects. It has been said that, if exercise were a pill, it would be prescribed to every patient by every doctor.The benefits of exercise are "transdiagnostic," meaning that regardless of which mental illness someone may be experiencing, everyone can still gain some benefits from exercise. The benefits may differ a little depending on the symptoms experienced. For example, for someone with depression, exercise may help to improve sleep quality or help provide motivation to get out of bed, while for someone experiencing anxiety symptoms, exercise may act as a distraction from constant worry.
