According to Maslow, our most basic needs — such as the need for food, air, and water — are inborn. These needs are required for the survival of our species. According to Maslow, humans are motivated to fulfill the obvious needs for survival first. Only once these needs are met do we begin to grow and focus on our "higher order" needs.This hierarchy is most often displayed as a pyramid. The lowest levels of the pyramid are made up of the most basic needs, while the more complex needs are located at the top of the pyramid.The first level in Maslow's hierarchy of needs:I. PHYSIOLOGICAL NEEDSPhysiological needs are the physical requirements for human survival. If these requirements are not met, the human body cannot function properly and will ultimately fail. Physiological needs are thought to be the most important; they should be met first.Air, water, and food are metabolic requirements for survival in all animals, including humans. Clothing and shelter provide necessary protection from the elements.
