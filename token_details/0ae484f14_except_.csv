One day, all the wild animals got together to choose a king. They saw that it would be good to choose Lion to be the king of the animals. At that meeting, they crowned Lion the king of the animals. As part of the ceremony, they had a big party that lasted a week. All of the animals attended the ceremony until the end. They ate, they drank, they sang and they danced. When the ceremony was over, they all dispersed. They were returning to their homes. It was the custom for every animal to go and greet Lion because he was their king. One visitor who came to greet King Lion was Hyena. When Hyena arrived at Lion's house, he found the king in bed. Lion told him, "I'm sick with an incurable illness." Hyena responded, "O, Great King, don't be sad because of your illness. Hare knows the cure for this illness." The reason Hyena said this was because he wanted to get Hare in trouble in the eyes of Lion. Hyena knew that Hare was unable to heal Lion. Lion cheered up and sent Hyena right away to call Hare.
