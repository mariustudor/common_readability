William was not afraid of being laughed at; and he felt much obliged to those who pointed out any faults in what he did. He was not discouraged by failures. He kept trying till he had used his pencil nearly all up. Still he had not yet made a good drawing of a horse."You'll never learn to draw: so you may as well give it up first as last," said his friend to him one day, some six months after their last meeting. "Your horses are all donkeys still."William opened a portfolio, and, taking out some pictures, said, "What do you think of these?""Ah! here is something like a horse," replied his friend, looking at one of the drawings. "You will never do anything like this, Willy."William smiled, but said nothing; though it was his own drawing that his friend was praising.
