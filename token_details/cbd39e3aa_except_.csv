Thoko was sitting on his father's wagon. It was piled high with mielies. There were many children on the wagon. They were going home after spending the whole day in the fields. They had all worked hard that day. Thoko was very lucky. He worked the hardest of all the children. So, his father had bought him a FantaPine drink from M'e Pontso's shop. "Mmmmm, mmmmm it is delicious," said Thoko. It was Thoko's favorite drink. He sipped it slowly. He wanted it to last him until they got to the top of the hill. At the top of the hill his father stopped to give the oxen a rest. "What a beautiful valley we live in children," he said. "We are lucky to live in such a clean, fresh place." He smiled. On they went. The sun was warm. The wagon was rocking gently from side to side as the oxen walked. The children were chatting softly to each other. Thoko felt sleepy. He wanted to lie down on the mielies and sleep a little. He looked at the empty FantaPine tin in his hand. "I am tired of holding this empty tin," he thought to himself.
