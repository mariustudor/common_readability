Once upon a time a Tiger was caught in a trap. He tried in vain to get out through the bars, and rolled and bit with rage and grief when he failed. By chance a poor Brahman came by."Let me out of this cage, oh pious one!" cried the Tiger."Nay, my friend," replied the Brahman mildly, you would probably eat me if I did.""Not at all!" swore the Tiger with many oaths; "on the contrary, I should be forever grateful, and serve you forever!"Now when the Tiger sobbed and sighed and wept and swore, the pious Brahman's heart softened, and at last he consented to open the door of the cage. Out popped the Tiger, and, seizing the poor man, cried, "What a fool you are! What is to prevent my eating you now, for after being cooped up so long I am terribly hungry!"In vain the Brahman Pleaded for his life; the most he could gain was a promise to abide by the decision of the first three things he chose to question as to the justice of the Tiger's action.
