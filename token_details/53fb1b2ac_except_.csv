An inventor in Boston has just perfected an excellent coat-hanger.At the first glance it looks like the ordinary hangers we have been using for so many years, but this invention obviates the one objection which attaches to all the other hangers we have come across—it adapts itself to the size of the place in which it is to be used.Those who live in small houses or apartments with meagre cupboard-room know that the old hanger is out of the question for them, two coats or waists taking up the entire length of the wardrobe.The new hanger is adjustable. Its arms work on a spring. It can stretch them out to the fullest extent where space is no object, but when used in a cupboard where every inch counts, the accommodating arms will fold together, and taking one sleeve of the coat or waist on each arm, lay them together in the same position they would be in if folded in a drawer.
