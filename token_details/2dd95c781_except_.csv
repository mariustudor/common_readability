Mister Popples told the squirrels, the squirrels told the birds, caterpillars, butterflies, tiny spiders and all those who lived in the little garden. There was total panic, a lot of running, flying, scurrying and hopping, with no one knowing what to do? Where to go? The caterpillars said, "Let us look for leaves." The butterflies said, "We want flowers." The mice wanted holes. The squirrels, birds, insects wanted trees, bushes and grass. All the animals wanted the soft earth, not cement or concrete. "Where will we find all this?" they cried. "We will surely die," they said and wept. Kato's uncle and aunt were very quiet and all the little squirrels crept close to their mom. Kato cleared his throat and spoke shyly, "I live in the Far Forest, maybe we can all go there?" There was a buzz of excitement and someone said, "How?" Kato scratched his head and thought hard, "Well, the Squirrel Express can take the squirrels and the butterflies, spiders caterpillars and all the insects. The birds can either fly or come with us. The moles, mice and the grass snake family can go by the underground Mole Express."
