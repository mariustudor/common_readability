Once in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest, and the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said: ‘Brother wolf, what bird is it that sings so well?' ‘That is the King of birds,' said the wolf, ‘before whom we must bow down.' In reality the bird was the willow-wren. ‘IF that's the case,' said the bear, ‘I should very much like to see his royal palace; come, take me thither.' ‘That is not done quite as you seem to think,' said the wolf; ‘you must wait until the Queen comes,' Soon afterwards, the Queen arrived with some food in her beak, and the lord King came too, and they began to feed their young ones. The bear would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held him back by the sleeve, and said: ‘No, you must wait until the lord and lady Queen have gone away again.' So they took stock of the hole where the nest lay, and trotted away. The bear, however, could not rest until he had seen the royal palace, and when a short time had passed, went to it again.
