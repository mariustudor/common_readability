"The General's Double," by Captain King, and "Trooper Ross and Signal Butte," by the same author, come to us from the press of J. B. Lippincott Company. The former is a capital story of the Civil War, the plot being based upon the remarkable likeness existing between two men in the Union army. It has all of the charm of the works of this favorite author.The second book contains two stories, the heroes of both being boys. The first, "Trooper Ross," describes the adventures of an officer's son, his exciting experiences with native americans on the plains as a little chap, taking his part at boarding-school later; then, failing to obtain his admission to West Point, he works his way through the ranks to his commission. "Signal Butte" covers a series of exciting adventures in Arizona, in which two boys are the central figures.
