If someone is in water, you can use a stick to pull the person to safety. Never get into the water to try and rescue someone. If you get into the water, you could also drown. If the person who needs help is too far away from you to reach with a stick, you can throw something that floats. Throw something they can hold on to and use to stay above the water. You could throw a soccer ball or an empty five-litre plastic container. If someone needs rescuing from water, ask a lifeguard or adult for help. Never go into the water to try and rescue someone yourself. You can also call the free national emergency number, 112, from a cell phone or a landline. If someone is rescued from the water and they are not breathing, you should call 112 for help. You can then start Hands-on CPR by pushing hard and fast in the centre of their chest. Do not practice this on a friend! You can find out more from the National Sea Rescue Institute.
