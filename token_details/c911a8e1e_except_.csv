Goat said, "Ehe, Pig! Come with me to my house. We are having a small party." When they were eating, Pig thought, "This food is so delicious. I think I will stay here forever. It was time for everybody to dance. But Pig danced alone on the side. At the end of the dance, they left. After a short while, Pig said, "I feel sick." The others decided to carry Pig to his home. But Pig cried and said, "Take me back to Goat's house instead. My home is too far." They put him down and said, "You are heavy. You can walk back if you want." Pig called to two of his friends, but they ran away without looking at him. Pig walked back to Goat's house. He thought, "I just want to eat the delicious food that Goat prepares." Goat was surprised to see Pig so soon. He asked, "Did you forget something?" Pig said, "My friend, I am sick." At that time, the others arrived and began quarrelling Pig. "You are lying. If you were sick, you would not have walked back here on your own."
