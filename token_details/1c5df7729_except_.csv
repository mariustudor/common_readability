When they were nearly home, Nozibele put her hand to her neck. She had forgotten her necklace! "Please come back with me!" she begged her friends. But her friends said it was too late. Nozibele went back to the river alone. She found her necklace and began hurrying home. But, she got lost in the dark. In the distance she saw light coming from a hut. She walked quickly towards it and knocked at the door. To her surprise, a dog opened the door and said, "What do you want?" "I'm lost and I need a place to sleep," said Nozibele. "Come in, or I'll bite you!" said the dog. Nozibele went in. The dog said, "Cook for me!" "But I've never cooked for a dog before," Nozibele answered. "Cook, or I'll bite you!" said the dog. Nozibele cooked some food for the dog. Then the dog said, "Make the bed for me!" Nozibele answered, "I've never made a bed for a dog." "Make the bed, or I'll bite you!" the dog said. Nozibele made the bed. Every day she had to cook and sweep and wash for the dog.
