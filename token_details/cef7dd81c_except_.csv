When going to the beach, find out which ones have lifeguards. Always try to visit beaches that have lifeguards watching the swimmers. The lifeguards on duty will put red and yellow flags on the beach to show you where it is safe to swim. Many people find it hard to see a rip current in the sea. Rip currents are like fast-flowing rivers that can pull even strong swimmers away from the beach. This is why it is better to swim between the lifeguard flags. If you get pulled out by a rip current, try not to panic. Try to swim to the left or to the right of the current's flow. Don't try to fight the current or to swim against the current. That will make you tired and more scared. To be safe when you visit the beach, you should always listen to the lifeguards. And make sure that you stay between the red and yellow flags on the beach. The flags show you where the currents are safe.
