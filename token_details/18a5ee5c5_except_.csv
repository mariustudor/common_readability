Ludwig was only four years old when he began to study music. Like children of today he shed many a tear over the first lessons. In the beginning his father taught him piano and violin, and forced him to practice. At school he learned, just as we do today, reading, writing, arithmetic, and later on, Latin.Never again after thirteen, did Ludwig go to school for he had to work and earn his living.Do you wonder what kind of a boy he was?We are told that he was shy and quiet. He talked little and took no interest in the games that his boy and girl companions played.While Ludwig was in school he played at a concert for the first time. He was then eight years old. Two years later he had composed quite a number of pieces. One of these was printed. It was called Variations on Dressler's March.
