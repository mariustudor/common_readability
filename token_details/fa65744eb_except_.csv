One Friday, the three friends decided to go in search of kola nuts in the forest. They wanted to sell at the market. After their parents left for the market, they also set off to the forest. They came to the River Dome, which was very full. Ntiamoa shouted, "Eei! How can we cross this river?" Nyameky answered, "I have read that when rivers overflow their banks you can cross by making a sacrifice." The children did not have anything to offer at that time, so they made promises to the river. Ntiamoa said, "Nana Dome if you will allow me to cross over, I will offer you three times three kola nuts." Nyameky made the same promise. When Adena's turn came, because of her pride, she promised, "Nana Dome, if you will allow me to cross over, on my return I will offer three times two kola nuts and two eggs." River Dome responded, "My grandchildren, cross over, and remember to fulfil your promises." After the children crossed the river safely, they went into the forest. They soon all filled their sacks with kola nuts. On their way home they got to the river again.
