When it becomes a question of practical lighting, it is very certain that the best electric lamp will be the one that is most simple and requires the fewest mechanical parts. It is to such simplicity that is due all the success of the Jablochkoff candle and the Reynier-Werdermann lamp. Yet, in the former of these lamps, it is to be regretted that the somewhat great and variable resistance opposed to the current in its passage through two carbons that keep diminishing in length, in measure as they burn, proves a cause of loss of light and of variation in it. And it is also to be regretted that the duration of combustion of the carbons is not longer; and, finally, it is allowable to believe that the power employed in volatilizing the insulator placed between the carbons is prejudicial to the economical use of this system. In order to obviate this latter inconvenience, an endeavor has been made in the Wilde candle to do away with the insulator, but the results obtained have scarcely been encouraging.
