That day, it was about cows at the market. "Push these silly cows away," she said. "They are eating my vegetables." "Hey you there! Push these silly cows away from here," she insisted. "They are eating my clothes." "Where is the owner of these silly cows?" she shouted. "They are eating my grains." Sorimpan, the herd boy, had just gone to drink water at a tap when his cows wandered off to the market. He hid away, squatting in fear, when he heard the shouting woman. "Now look what these silly cows have done!" she continued to shout. "They have broken my beautiful pots." A short time later, "Aah! Not again!" she was heard saying. "I will report this matter to the police. These silly cows have knocked down my fruit stand." Sorimpan finally came out stick in hand, dodged between the gathering crowds and managed to get a clear view of his cows. Sorimpan's cows knew him well so they turned and looked up at him as he appeared! At this point, the big crowd of onlookers of men, women and even children all stared at the cows which paid attention only to Sorimpan.
