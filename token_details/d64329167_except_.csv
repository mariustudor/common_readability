Here is a boy drawing on a wall. He is a shoemaker's boy. His name is Bob.Tom, the baker's boy, and a little girl named Ann are looking on. "What is it?" asks Ann at sight of the picture."It's a fine lady, of course," says Tom. "Don't you see her head-dress and her sun-shade?" Bob is so busy that he cannot stop to talk.He is well pleased with his work. But the man who is looking around the corner of the wall does not look pleased in the least.It is plain that he has no love for the fine arts. Or it may be that he does not like to see such a rough sketch on his wall.Perhaps he thinks that when boys are sent on an errand, they ought not to loiter by the way.
