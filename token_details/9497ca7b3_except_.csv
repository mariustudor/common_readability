One day, Chat was strolling in the garden. She liked the sweet scent of flowers. She loved to touch their soft petals. Chat wished she could see flowers, just once. "They are lovely," she said to herself. Every day, Chat walked in the garden. She knew her way around. Today, she raised her head to the skies. Suddenly, she heard thunder and lightning. "I need to hurry back to the house," Chat thought. Rain began to fall. Chat slipped, lost her balance and fell. She hit her head on a stone. When Chat woke up, there were people around her. "What happened?" she asked. "You fell and bumped your head," her father said. "Thank God you are fine," said her mother. "Daddy, mummy?" asked Chat. She also called the names of her brothers and sisters. "Please, get me a flower." Everyone was surprised. Her sister returned with a flower. Chat held it gently. "It is so lovely," she said. Her family looked at one another. "Chat, can you see the flower?" her mother asked. Chat played with the flower in her hand. "You are all so beautiful, just like this flower," she smiled.
