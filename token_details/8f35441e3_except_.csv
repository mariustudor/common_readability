Every day, Emeka's father took him to school in his car. He also brought Emeka home after school. One afternoon on their way home, Emeka's father stopped to buy something at a big shop. From the car, Emeka looked across the road and saw an old man. He was carrying a big load on his head. He was tired and walked slowly. Emeka kept looking at him. The old man sat under the shade of a tree on the walkway and opened his bag. He had two flat plastic water bottles, which he was making into shoes. Emeka thought about that old man for a long time. He felt sad. When he got home, he could not eat. He thought about what he could do. He got up and took some money from his money bag. He called Chita and jumped on his bicycle. Emeka rode to the shop where his father had shopped. The boy ran into the shop and came out with a bag. He went to where the old man was resting against a tree. Emeka called out, "Good afternoon, sir." The man answered, "Peace to you, my child."
