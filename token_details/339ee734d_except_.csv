Scientists estimate that we share this planet with millions of other species! But how do we know which species are out there and how can we keep track of them? Unfortunately, humans are driving lots of species to extinction and disrupting important natural ecosystems. It is now more important than ever that we understand which species are present in different places and the roles they play in their ecosystems. With this knowledge, we can figure out how to protect important organisms and their habitats. Exciting new technology has made it possible to identify species using DNA that they have released into the environment—this is known as environmental DNA (eDNA). Scientists are now using eDNA to identify species in all kinds of ecosystems across the world. In this article, we explain how eDNA is used to detect species and describe the advantages and disadvantages of this method.
