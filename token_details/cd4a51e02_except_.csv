"Mollie Thurston, we are lost!" cried Barbara dramatically.The two sisters were in the depth of a New Jersey woods one afternoon in early September."Well, what if we are!" laughed Mollie, leaning over to add a cluster of wild asters to her great bunch of golden rod. "We have two hours ahead of us. Surely such clever woodsmen as we are can find our way out of woods which are but a few miles from home. Suppose we should explore a real forest some day. Wouldn't it be too heavenly! Come on, lazy Barbara! We shall reach a clearing in a few moments.""You lack sympathy, Miss Mollie Thurston; that's your trouble."Barbara was laughing, yet she anxiously scanned the marshy ground as she picked her way along."I wouldn't mind being lost in these woods a bit more than you do, if I were not so horribly afraid of snakes. Oh, my! this place looks full of 'em."
