It had been a bright day, but the evening was chilly; and, as she watched the glowing logs that were blazing on her hearth, she wished that all the lighted part of them would turn to gold.She was very much in the habit—this little wife—of building castles in the air, particularly when she had nothing else to do, or her husband was late in coming home to his supper. Just as she was thinking how late he was there was a tap at the door, and an old man walked in, who said:"Mistress, will you give a poor man a warm at your fire?""And welcome," said the young woman, setting him a chair.So he sat down as close to the fire as he could, and spread out his hands to the flames.He had a little knapsack on his back, and the young woman did not doubt that he was an old soldier."Maybe you are used to the hot countries," she said."All countries are much the same to me," replied the stranger. "I see nothing to find fault with in this one."
