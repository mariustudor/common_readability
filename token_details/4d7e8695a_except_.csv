The hyena and the monkey had an argument. They went to a judge to settle their differences. After the judge listened to their case, he was afraid to pass judgement on their case. He thought to himself, "If I condemn the hyena, it will eat all my cattle. And if I condemn the monkey, he will eat all my corn! So, what am I to do?" The judge thought for a while, and said, "The case is too difficult for me to judge alone. You should go to the elders of the village." So, the hyena and monkey went to the elders. They told the elders about their disagreement. After the elders listened to their case, they were also afraid to pass judgement. If they supported the monkey, the hyena might eat their cattle. If they supported the hyena, the monkey might eat their corn. The elders told Hyena and Monkey that their case was very difficult. Suddenly, the elders remembered a poor woman in the town. She had nothing to lose, neither cattle nor corn. "She can pass the judgement without any fear," said the elders to one another. They told the two animals to go to her.
